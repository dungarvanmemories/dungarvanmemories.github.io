<EM>For almost 60 years Johnny Curran ran rings around those respectable citizens who tried to put a stop to his hilariously crafty tricks. In 1895 most of the Town Commissioners resigned in protest at his crookedness as a Town Commissioner. They played right into his hands. He got himself elected as Chairman of the Town Commissioners and then did what he liked  for the next four years. He owned a pub on Grattan Square where the Enterprise Bar is today.</EM><P>

A MORE AUDACIOUS MOVE WAS NEVER PERPETRATED</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">A meeting was summoned the
branch of the United Irish League in Dungarvan for the purpose of
expelling the Napoleon of the branch John Curran and his aide de camp
Michael J. Casey for aiding and abetting the candidature of Matty
Walsh for the District Council. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">The meeting was summoned for
one and about that hour Messrs Curran, Casey and Matthew Scanlan
might be seen winding their way with giant strides to the Town Hall.
Without even allowing themselves time to recover their breathing
powers Mr Scanlan proposed and Mr Casey seconded that John Curran
take the chair ! It was no wonder the coolness of the proceeding
flabbergasted those present, for a more audacious move was never
perpetrated. Mr John Walsh, the square, moved that Michael J. Casey
and John Curran be expelled from the branch. John Tobin seconded and
they were cast out.</FONT></P>

THE MISSING MONEY</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Meeting of the United Irish
League. Curran accused of taking money from the Home Rule fund.
Curran claimed the Chairman James Hayes had not paid his
subscription.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran - You didn't pay a
half penny.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">James Hayes - I did.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael J.Casey - Who did you
pay?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Tobin - This is only
raising a storm.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael J.Casey - You keep
quiet.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Tobin - We won't run away
from you at all. ( To Curran) You kept &#163;3 out of the Home Rule
fund.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael J.Casey - This is a man
of straw who is making charges here.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Earlier Hayes had run towards
Curran in a threatening attitude when Curran had said Tomasheen
Hackett had put him in a bucket.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Hayes - No he never . Bring him
out here. I will meet him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Hayes was restrained and he
returned to his seat.</FONT></P>

YOU WOULD GET A PLASTER ON YOUR HEAD</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">At a United Irish League
meeting Curran had claimed Patrick Ryan had rushed up behind him in
the street and threatened him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Patrick Ryan - I wouldn't hurt
you Mr Curran in a thousand years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran - You would get a
plaster on your head if you did.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mar 1913<BR>

MR CURRAN ASSUMED A PUGILISTIC ATTITUDE</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Meeting of the Dungarvan Branch
of the United Irish League</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">The meeting room was crowded
before the time of the meeting, and the landing outside the room was
thronged with people who were evidently waiting to hear the
procedings which judging from the previous adjourned meetings, were
certain to be of a lively nature. The storm opened in a scuffle
between  P.Ryan and John Curran as to the door being open or shut.
One was trying to shut the door of the room and the other was trying
to keep it open.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran - I am not going to
stand any of your blackguarding any longer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">P.Ryan - Oh, it is quite
evident 'tis a row you want.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael J.Casey ( coming to
Curran's assistance) - We will have no more of this Ryan. We won't
give you your way here.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">William Power - You won't have
your way either.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - I won't have any of
your interference. Mind your own business I tell you.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Power - This is my business. I
am able to take care of myself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - If you are, come on.
Here, take my coat. Come on now, you bloody fool, you.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Curran here assumed a
pugilistic attitude to the evident delight of the majority of the
crowd, several of them cheered "Good man, Curran."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan ( to Power) - Don't mind
him, he only wants to cause a row. It suits him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - Come on, I will take
you on now.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">There were shouts of
encouragement to Mr Curran, Mr Casey's voice being distinctly
audible, shouting "Bravo Curran."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey (to Ryan) - Mr Curran is
a better mark than you and so am I or Mr Stack.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Of course, you want to
kick up a row tonight, but we won't row with you.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - Oh, the ratepayers
ought to be proud of you and your law costs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - They should be proud of
you and the expenses you put them to.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - I will quieten you, my
boy, and others of your class too.</FONT></P>

to Dungarvan Urban Council.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">William Stokes got only one
vote and that was from Michael Byrne.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">J.J.O'Shea - I would like to
know who proposed Stokes</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Patrick Sexton - John Curran
and he voted against him (laughter).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran - Everyone can do
what they like.</FONT></P>

CURRAN SUED FOR WAGES</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Jeremiah Cleary sued John
Curran for wages owed to him by Curran. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">A.E.Ryan (for Cleary) - Cleary
was a labourer employed by Curran for 5 shillings a week and diet.
Curran had a large shop on the square and a large farm. He had 10
cows which needed to be milked and a lot of tillage had also to be
done. Curran had another man employed by the name of Cluck - not Von
Cluck (laughter) - and he and the plantiff and a girl had to attend
the farm.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - This is the fifth
labourer I have written to you about this year.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - It is a good job for
you that there are so many labourers (laughter).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran ordered to pay 8s 4d to
Cleary.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Oct 1916<BR>

LATE MAILS</FONT></B></P>

meeting of the Dungarvan Urban Council about the late mails.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Brennock - Some men don't
receive their letters until 10.30 in the day, especially professional
men -</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran - And they can't
read them then. Some of them are not out of bed at that time
(laughter).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Jan 1917<BR>

"FOXY THIS" AND "BLIND THAT"</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran accused his valet
and servant Daniel Lynch of stealing a 10 shilling note. Lynch had
worked for Curran for 9 months and was an old aged pensioner. Curran
had left the note on a book in his shop and had then left to go to
the courthouse and when he came back the money was gone. He then
challenged Lynch to give him the money. When Lynch denied he had
taken it Curran locked him in the kitchen and called the
police.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">A.E.Ryan (defending Lynch) said
Lynch had &#163;28 in his Post Office book and when searched by the
police he did not have a 10s note on him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan (to Curran) - Where do you
keep your money?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - I am not going to tell
you.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Surely you are not
afraid that I am going to steal any of it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - How do I know what
you'd do? War times, you know. These things are very tempting
(laughter).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Don't you make your
place the rendezvous for fellows who go by the name of "Foxy this"
and "Blind that"? How often has Lynch caught people in the act of
putting their hand round the counter and trying to steal bottles of
stout ? Did you accuse him before of stealing a quarter pound of
butter and a quarter of sugar, or something like that, from your shop
some time ago, and you would not be satisfied until the man went and
pointed these things out to you in your shop ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Case dismissed.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mar 1917<BR>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Johanna Noonan sued John Curran
for money owed to her. She had worked for Curran's deceased sister
Mrs Fitzgerald, Ballycreen. Mrs Fitzgerald had promised her &#163;9 a
year but she had only received about &#163;3 in the last six years
she was there. Curran who had inherited the farm claimed that Noonan
had agreed to accept &#163;10 for what she was owed and an agreement
was written out.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Judge Fitzgerald - Did she sign
it ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">J.F.Williams (for Curran) -
Yes, with her mark.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">A.E.Ryan - You don't know Mr
Curran, my lord (laughter).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran said the signing was
witnessed by Daniel Lynch.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Is this Daniel Lynch the
man who served a writ on you some time ago ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - You ought to know
that. You got &#163;2 5s out of it (laughter).</FONT></P>

JOHNNY CURRAN WAS A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE</FONT></B></P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">
Maurice Griffin ( in court for drinking after hours) - On my way there (Terry's) I met a man who told me Johnny Curran was after dying.<P>
Ryan - And it was grief that drove you to drink ?<P>
Griffin - Johnny Curran was a good friend of mine, but I found afterwards that he wasn't dead at all</FONT><P>
