<EM>Father Casey, a fearless enemy of the British and the Freemasons, never shrank from condemning the wrongdoer, as he saw it, even if it meant attacking fellow priests and the nuns. His outspokenness meant he did not become a Parish Priest until quite late in his life.</EM><P>

DO NOT DIE OF HUNGER MY MAN. IF YOU CAN'T GET THEM ANY OTHER WAY
STEAL THEM.</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">The Rev. Richard J.Casey and
the Protestant curate Rev. Mr Lane were received at Kilmacthomas
Board of Guardians as a deputation relative to the state of
Kilrossanty. Father Casey examined several starving men before the
board who said the only food they had eaten was some Indian meal
Father Casey had given them. One said he lived on turnips before he
got the meal. When asked where he got the turnips he made no reply.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Father Casey - Don't die of
hunger my man. If you cannot get them any other way steal
them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Father Casey said there were
between 50 and 60 families in Kilrossanty living on 2 meals of
turnips and Indian meal a day. He mentioned the case of Kerns of
Glendalgan and his wife who both died of typhoid. They had 6
children. They all lived in a tiny cabin big enough only for 2. Dr
A.W.Kirwan said to Father Casey that the fever was the result of
starvation. Kerns was dead for 2 days before anyone knew about the
family.</FONT></P>

DOWN WITH DISSENSION !</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">An unusually large meeting of
our City League Branch was held in the Town Hall on Monday evening
about 8pm. Father Casey, arriving early, was greeted with a hearty
clap. The Mayor's entrance caused a very enthusiastic outburst...
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Father Casey rose from his seat
in the body of the Hall and addressed the chairman - Is this the
proper time to bring forward a resolution ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mayor - It depends on what the
resolution is.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Father Casey - Can't you give a
straightforward answer to a straightforward question (applause)
?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mayor - What do you mean
?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Father Casey - I ask is this
the proper time to bring forward a resolution ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr McRedmond - Give an
answer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mayor - Hold your
tongue.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Father Casey - I will take the
sense of the meeting.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mayor - Come up, Father Casey,
and submit your resolution to the committee.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Father Casey - I don't know
that is customary, I am not a member of the committee; you are not
supposed to know my intentions. If the meeting is prepared to accept
or reject it, it is their business (hear, hear).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mayor - All right, I will
accept the resolution.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">After some conversation among
the members of the committee the Mayor left and Rev.P.J.Sheenan took
the chair.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Father Casey then moved :- That
in view of the recent charges - the recent very serious charges -
made and promulgated against our honorary secretary, Mr Mannering, we
deem it advisable in the interests of this association of the Irish
National League, of which we are members, that he should either
contradict or explain such charges; and that he hereby be suspended
from the position of honorary secretary until such time as he has
done either one or the other.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">I stand (said the rev. speaker)
on the merits of my resolution... I like to see a straightforward man
put forward in an honourable position, and if he disgraces it he
ought to be put into obscurity. As to the charge of seeking admission
to a secret society, made so prominently - we all know what becoming
a member of a Masonic Hall means - unless that charge is
contradicted, I declare openly that I, as a priest, will cease my
connection with the National League (applause from the back part of
the room).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mayor - I am not aware there
are freemasons aiding the National cause. We have to take aid from
whatever quarter we can get it, if it is faithfully and honestly
rendered (hear,hear).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Father Casey - I think it is
right to speak to the resolution -</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Chairman - I think I have given
too much latitude (loud and prolonged cheering).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Father Casey - Pardon me, Mr
Chairman, I must be heard (interruption) -</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Chairman - I am going to put
the amendment -</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Father Casey, amid uproar,
attempted to speak. His voice was lost in shouts of "chair, chair" -
Is that the man that a Catholic population like this elects as
secretary ? (uproar).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">A voice - Isn't Parnell a
Protestant ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Father Casey - With all respect
to the chair I have a great responsibility -</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Chairman - Any other member who
wishes -</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Father Casey here raised his
voice to a passionate pitch, but it was immediately drowned in a
fierce outcry, and shouts of "order," during which the rev. chairman
and Father Casey still remained standing. The latter turned towards
the door, and elbowing his way through the members, left the room.
His exit was the signal for an outburst of excited cheering.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Chairman (silence having been
restored) - We had enough of that before - I think it is done with
now (renewed cheering).</FONT></P>

THE RECENT NATIONAL LEAGUE MEETING</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">DEAR SIR - Permit me to ask
Father Sheehan, Adm., through the medium of your paper, for an
explanation, or an apology, for his discourteous conduct towards a
fellow-priest at the recent meeting in the Town Hall, when he
endeavoured and even encouraged (as chairman), portion of the
assembly to drown my voice when speaking to a resolution which I had
prepared, and which, according to the rules that regulate every
well-conducted and respectable assembly, I had a perfect right to
speak to. Again at the close of the discussion which it elicited, it
was whilst in the act of exercising this right, and just before he
put the resolution from the chair, that Father Sheenan in a
dictatorial and offensive manner, said "I will not hear you. We have
had too much of this thing" (or words of this nature). Now this
looked like a studiously arranged bit of discourtesy to prevent
legitimate discussion on an important and interesting subject,.viz. -
charges of a serious nature which have been alleged against the hon.
sec. of the branch, and which he seems indisposed to explain, or
unable to contradict. In other words, Father Sheenan's undignified
action towards me on this occasion looked as if it were necessary for
him to be offensive to me (though I did not give him the least
provocation, nor did anyone else) in order that he may succeed all
the more effectively in whitewashing Mr Manning, which he did not do
and cannot do. If such were his motives he ought, in honour to
himself and justice to me, offer an explanation or an apology to the
public, but in the event of him refusing to do so, I wish him glory
in his success. - I am, dear sir, yours truly, R.J.Casey,C.C.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">NB.- The man who has proved
faithless and treacherous to the Church of his father and forefathers
by seeking admission into the Freemason Society will, in my
estimation, have less hesitation in proving false, faithless and
treacherous to the National cause if occasion offers, and that is the
stamp of the man the Waterford Branch I.N.L. retains as its hon. sec.
I ask the plain question of every right-thinking man and honest
Nationalist who may read this, is such a man, or even his supporters,
above suspicion an Nationalists ? R.J.C</FONT></P>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><A HREF="kilmurry.html">THE KILMURRY
EVICTION AND THE DUNGARVAN NUNS</A></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">DEAR SIR - I read in Saturday's issue of the
Citizen Mr. Walsh's reply to Mr.P.J.Power's letter, in which he (Mr.
Patrick Walsh, the evicted tenant) introduces a letter of mine,
written on the eve of Christmas, 1888, when his eviction from his
comfortable home had just been effected by the nuns, and when he and
his large family were thrown out on the wayside by a community of
religious, who are supposed to be more mindful than ordinary good
Catholics of the solemnity of Xmastide ... Now sir, I know as much of
this case between this religious community and their victim
(Mr.Walsh) as most people now living (I believe Father O'Riordan,
President St John's Collage, knows quite as much) and I must say it
is nothing short of a gross libel on the justice and impartiality of
the cause so warmly and righteously espoused by Mr. Davit at
--------- some ten years ago, and ever since supported at much
sacrifice to life and health, by gentlemen of of such unsullied
characters as Messers O'Brien, Dillon, Davit &amp;c, to allow it to
be said that any gentleman claiming to be a colleague can associate
with the above "honoured patriots" (in the truest sense of the word),
should shirk the responsibility of declaring this case to be one of
unjust eviction and particularly when I know that Mr.P.J.Power M.P.,
was delegated by a representative  conference of his constituents to
do so to set public feeling and much uncharitable talk at rest at
once and for ever. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Now, sir, this action on the part of Mr. Power
suggests a few questions to my mind which I will ask him to answer.
1st. Has Mr. Power the courage of giving expression to his opinions
on matters essentially and exclusively appertaining to the welfare
and success of the National movement regardless of the consequences?
2nd. Is the conduct of capricious landlords when they happen to be
members of a religious community less censurable or less deserving of
exposure and public criticism than that of a Clanricarde, or a Lord
Waterford, or a Stuart, or can they shield their conduct behind any
rule of the National League ? <BR>

Yours truly<BR>

R.J.Casey,C.C.</FONT></P>

THE REV. RICHARD J.CASEY,C.C.</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Readers of the Munster Express
in all parts of the County of Waterford will be glad to have a
picture of the above true hearted priest, than whom no clergyman in
Ireland has done and sacrificed more for the cause of Nationality.
Father Casey was born in Kilrossenty, Co Waterford, in the year 1851,
and is therefore 39 years of age. His father was Mr Pierce Casey, and
the family is a very old and respected one. Richard was sent to
school at Dungarvan, the establishment being known as Dwyer's
Boarding School, and was then entered at St John's College,
Waterford, from where he was ordained priest in 1875. His first
charge, singular to relate, was that of his native spot Kilrossenty,
and a right hearty welcome he received from the people of the parish
when he returned to them as their soggarth aroon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Times were beginning to get
lively just then, and in 1879 Father Richard established a branch of
the Land League in Kilrossenty, thus saving many families from
eviction and the emigrant ship. In appreciation of all his great
services he was in 1881 presented with a gold watch and chain by his
parishioners of Kilrossenty and Fews and Father Casey today prizes
that watch amongst all his possessions as a token of gratitude and
fidelity from the people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">About this time (81-82) the
tenants of Mr Palliser sought a reasonable reduction in their rents,
which the agent Mr Langley, Tay Lodge, declined to grant. The
tenants, under the leadership of Father Casey, continued to hold
their meetings and withhold their rents until they could force Mr
Langley to recognise the justice of their claims.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">A series of meeting were held,
at each of which Father Casey presided; but things were getting too
warm for the rack renters and a conspiracy of shoneens was formed.
For what ? Nothing less than to accomplish the arrest of the reverend
gentleman, whom to get out of the way was a sure way to evict the
tenants. Accordingly a report was sent to the Castle by the leaders
of the shoneen gang that Father Casey was a very "suspicious
character;" and in due course a document was forwarded to Mr Heard,
then County Inspector of Waterford, which was simply an order from
the Castle to squelch Father Casey. The people of Kilrossenty having
heard the little dodge of the enemy determined not to allow them to
have their own way without protesting against the abominable
conspiracy, and so some good men were told to keep faithful watch and
ward over the priest's house. Just at this time Father Casey was
transferred - it was stated on account of his political action - to
Clonea; thence to Cappequin; then to Ballyporeen; thence to Ardfinan;
and, at last, the City of Waterford; and now having administered here
for over six years, he is to-day as ardent and true a Nationalist as
he was in the old days in Kilrossenty.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Father Casey has of late
suffered much from a bronchial attack, and has been ordered to leave
Waterford for a short time. May he long be spared to minister to his
loving parishioners.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Jan 1892<BR>

THE CONVENTION CONFLICT</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">The most important case set
down for hearing before Judge Walters at the quarter sessions was the
appeal entered into by Father Richard Casey C.C. and the other five
defendants convicted under the Crimes Act by Messers. Considine and
McLeod, Resident Magistrates, of having taken part in a riot on the
occasion of the Whig Convention held recently in this city.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Ryan Q.C - ...it appears
that a Member of Parliament, a Mr Dillon, was one of the principle
persons connected with the meeting of the Conventionist delegates,
and he came from some part of the country to Waterford about 11.30
o'clock. The authorities has, they were bound to do, drafted in a
considerable force of constabulary for the purpose of maintaining
the peace of the city, and certainly their foresight was right. There
was a procession formed to receive Mr Dillon, and among others very
prominent was the Rev. Mr Casey. While the processionists were
crossing the bridge, nearly the first act I find done, which lead in
a great measure to what took place afterwards, was this rev.
gentleman, the Rev. Mr Casey, standing up in the vehicle - in which
he rode along with Mr John Dillon - and calling, cheering, shouting,
and gesticulating very wildly. That, of course, if passed over would
not amount to a riot, but unfortunately the rank and file took their
cue from this and began to wave their sticks. This was crossing the
bridge, and at the city side of the bridge was formed a large party
of Parnellites, who evidently were only waiting for a row, and the
others appeared ready to gratify them...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Bodkin R.M., in answer to Mr
Ryan deposed he saw Father Casey standing up in the wagonette and
waving his hat. The people in the procession then cheered and waved
their sticks.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Jan 1892<BR>

QUASHED.FATHER CASEY'S CONVICTION UTTERLY WRONG.</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">On Tuesday Judge Walters gave
his decision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">His Honor Said - Although I am
of the opinion that the convictions are bad in law, I mean to deal
with one of them separately. The Rev R Casey, a Roman Catholic priest
has been found guilty of taking part in a riot and he has been
sentenced to two months imprisonment, and at the expiration of that
term to give securities for the peace and for good behaviour for
twelve months. Such a conviction and sentence naturally casts
disgrace upon the character of any man, disgrace which is greatly
intensified in the person of a minister of religion... In my opinion
the conviction of Father Casey is utterly unjustifiable. It is
unsupported by fact, and it is unfounded in law, and I reverse it and
dismiss the charges against him on the merits. (Applause). I will
have no display of any kind in this court.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Feb 19O8<BR>

LETTER FROM R.J.C DUNGARVAN</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">I have read with much interest
the remarks by L.M.C in your last issue. It strikes me that these
words of warning are badly needed, and I hope they will be pondered
on by all intending emigrants. Too much cannot be said or written
with regard to this burning question and it must be obvious to every
right thinking man that emigration is slowly but surely accomplishing
that which all the arts of England failed to do - the extermination
of the Irish race. With what jubilation the English parties - Tory
and Liberal - view the situation ! While our politicians are playing
their own game for their own benefit, the people are compelled day
after day, to fly the land of their birth in a fierce struggle for
existence. They go to a country with a vast population where they
have difficulty in obtaining even the most menial employment. Little
wonder that it is, then, that so many of these poor emigrants sink
into obscurity and wretchedness in the slums of New York, Boston and
the other large American cities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">... "The American letter" is
scarcely ever accurate in its account of conditions of life out
there. The emigrant will never tell exactly what his position is, nor
will he tell the hardships he forced to endure. What a vast number of
Irish youths may be found loitering along the streets and corners of
the American towns and cities looking in vain for the means of
subsistence, cursing the day he set foot on the emigrant ship, and
praying that God in his mercy may give them the opportunity of
returning again to their native village in Ireland...When an Irish
girl returns home after spending some years in the land of the
"Almighty Dollar" does she not excite our commiseration ? We look
with sorrow on her pale, sunken cheeks, and we remember that only a
few years ago "Red as a rose was she." </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">... Are we, who have survived
centuries of oppression at the hands of our brutal taskmasters to be
allured from our own country by vague dreams of gaining opulence and
comfort in a far land ? Oh, youths and maidens of Dungarvan and
surrounding districts, ponder seriously on this important question.
If you are patriotic, if you take pride in the reading of the
glorious deeds of your ancestors, why not make a resolution to live
in the land for which they fought and died ? Where can we find
mountains more grand and striking, valleys more fragrant, and streams
more clear and limpid than those we have in our own beautiful Ireland
? We may roam thro' this world, but fairer scenes will never meet our
eyes than the sunlight sparkling on Killarney's lakes and falls or
the mist hanging over "the sweet vale of Avoca." ... In conclusion, I
would appeal to the girls of Dungarvan to stay in the old land, and I
am sure the boys will follow the good example. Therefore to every
cailin in the "Old Borough" and the surrounding districts who feels
inclined to cross the Atlantic I would address the following word of
a young Irish poet :</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Asthoreen, cling to the dear
old land,<BR>

And never desert it's soil;<BR>

Oh, never flee o'er the darkening sea,<BR>

Amid stranger scenes to toil.<BR>

Cling to the lands of the olden faith,<BR>

Home of the shamrock green;<BR>

Abroad you're only a stranger's slave,<BR>

At home you're an Irish queen.</FONT></P>
