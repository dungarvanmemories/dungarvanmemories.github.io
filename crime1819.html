<h3 class="western"><b>Mar 1819<br/>
Waterford Spring Assizes</b></h3>
<p>Judge's (Hon Baron George) speech to the Grand Jury</p>
<p>&ldquo;The criminal calendar now before me is such as perhaps was
never seen within these walls before, containing a catalogue of every
crime, I may say, ever committed by man, except high treason. When I
look at this catalogue, gentlemen, I declare I can hardly believe I
am sitting in the Court House of the County of Waterford; it is such
as would almost force one to imagine that it is the Calendar of the
County of Tipperary and we are now in the Court House of Clonmel!&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Patrick Bryan, indicted for proposing to one Thomas Clancy to
murder Arthur Keily Esq and a person by the name of Tobin, was
acquitted, there being no prosecution. He was remanded to gaol, being
under a rule of transportation as a vagabond since the Assizes.</p>
<p>Nicholas Keily hanged for stealing a mare from outside the house
of Miles Walsh, Kilmacthomas.</p>
<p>Thomas Finucane and Thomas Veale hanged for burglaries at
Derrinlar.</p>
<p>Patrick Bluett hanged for attacking and robbing the constable at
Ballinamutina.</p>
<p>Thomas Carroll hanged for cow stealing.</p>
<p>Michael Green, Laurence Murphy and Daniel Keane hanged. 
</p>
<p>Samuel Judd transported for 7 years for stealing several articles
of clothes at Currahmore.</p>
<p>Joanna Lynch transported for 7 years for stealing 2 cloaks and a
petticoat from Maurice Connery at Ballybrusa.</p>

Michael Roche, Dromana.</p>
<p>From Baron George<font face="SimSun"><span lang="zh-CN">&#65426;</span></font>s
speech to the condemned men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lives and properties of the peaceable and industrious
part of the community cannot possibly be secured, unless such
examples are made, in order to deter other infatuated men from the
commission of outrages and crimes; you have therefore no ground to
hope for any mitigation of your fate.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 class="western"><b>Aug 1819<br/>
Waterford Summer Assizes</b></h3>
<p>Thomas Manning and John Neil hanged for the rape of Eleanor
Downing on Sunday 30th May 1819.</p>
<p>From Baron McClelland's sentencing speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You Thomas Manning and John Neil have been convicted of the
foul, detestable and wicked crime of rape and in all my judicial
experience I think a more atrocious case never came before me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baron McClelland was upset that the crime was committed on a
Sunday. 
</p>
<p>&ldquo;A day on which it might be expected that even the worst and
wickedest of men might set some restraint on their evil
dispositions...Everyone of proper feeling must be aware, that it is
essential to the best interest of Society, that female chastity
should be preserved inviolate from the assaults of ruffian violence -
that females of every condition in life should be able to walk abroad
in security, confident of finding a certain protection for their
persons in the strong arm of the law...It is essentially necessary to
the welfare of Society that you should suffer death - not merely as a
punishment for your atrocious crime, but also as a warning to all
others who may be the slaves of their filthy lusts, to caution them
against the indulgence of their brutal appetites.&rdquo;</p>
