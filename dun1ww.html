Commissioners</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Sep 1914<BR>

They will mow down the Germans</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">The Chairman said that they did
not want to be under German rule anyhow.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael J.Casey - Oh, by God
no.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael Brenmock - This was a
war made by a big bully upon Belgium - a gallant little people who
were being crushed and persecuted by this vast horde of savages. It
was time to stop it and Ireland's place was at the front.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">M.J. Casey - They will mow down
the Germans.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Jan 1916<BR>

Dungarvan men at front</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">The Clerk of Dungarvan Urban
Council says 6 or 7 hundred Dungarvan men have joined the
forces.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Jan 1916<BR>

The "Corner Boys" Controversy</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Captain Hunter had bought 30
tons of hay from James Foley of Mapstown for the Government. The hay
had then been set on fire at Foley's farm. The Crown had then claimed
against the County Council for the cost of the hay, claiming the
burning had been malicious. Mr Tweedy, the Crown Solicitor, Dublin,
suggested it had been the work of Sinn Fein. There had been Sinn Fein
posters in Dungarvan urging young men not to volunteer. Patrick Ryan,
Mapstown, giving evidence as an interested ratepayer, said he could
not name a single Sein Fein member in the whole of Dungarvan. He said
the fire had been started by tramps. E.A.Ryan, appearing on behalf of
the ratepayers, questioned Sergent O'Neill, who had been stationed in
Dungarvan for 3 years. O'Neill said he had seen Sein Fein posters in
Dungarvan. Ryan suggested strangers had put them up. O'Neill replied
that they had been freshly gummed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Arthur Ryan - Don't you know
Dungarvan has sent more recruits to the army then any other
town.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">O'Neill - I have ascertained
that the labouring classes and what are termed "the corner boys" have
joined the army very largely. The shopkeeper's sons have not joined
and the farmer's sons have not joined and these are the men that
might be likely to carry a bottle of gum and a brush around. Judge
D.Fitzgerald KC decided the cost of the hay should be levied on the
urban and rural councils.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">O'Neill's evidence caused a
storm at the next meeting of Dungarvan Urban Council.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael Brennock - Another nice
statement was made regarding some of the poor fellows whose blood is
now in Gallipoli and Flanders. They were simply called
"corner boys". It was the most scandalous and uncalled for remark
ever made by an ignorant policeman.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Thomas Power - 19 or 20 of the
men who went were in his employment and they were all industrious and
truly respectable young men.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Brennock - Men who were saving
the British Army from defeat while that fellow was giving evidence to
mulct their people at home.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">William Stack - You must pass a
resolution condemning this. The sergeant and the old Head ( Head
Constable Dennehy) are a pair of villains.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael J.Casey - If I had been
in court I would have challenged his statement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran - Why didn't the
Government insure their hay ? We are already overburdened with
rates.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mar 1916<BR>

The people are already gone</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Claude Anson wrote to the
Dungarvan Urban Council asking them to recruit men personally.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael Brennock - I don't see
the utility of a personal canvas at present. The town is well
drained</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran - There is Charlie
Humble with thousands of acres and he evicted the people from his
lands and sent them to foreign shores; and there is Sir John Keene
and others of his Cromwellian spawn. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael Byrne - They closed up
all the minerals long ago - some of the finest minerals in the world.
Mr Curran never reared a family like me, but these people closed up
the minerals -</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael J.Casey - Hammer them,
hammer them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Byrne - It is good enough for
them. There are fathers and mothers who reared families in Dungarvan
and when Mr Curran goes for election they should not place him on a
public board.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Patrick Sexton - You are
getting personal now.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - Whatever have I done
to you ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Byrne - You never went to the
labour of raising sons, the same as other men in Dungarvan.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - It is cheaper not
to.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael J.Casey said there are
no people to recruit. The people are already gone.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Byrne - I care for no
Government, even the Government I am ruled by. I don't care that much
(snapping his fingers). They were a persecuting Government for
centuries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - Even since the days of
Cromwell.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mar 1916<BR>

The German Government is far superior to it</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Discussion of a resolution
passed at Mansion House, Dublin against further increases in
taxation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Thomas Power said they were all
in agreement with the resolution but an attempt was being made to
usurp the function of the Irish Parliamentary Party. An agitation of
this kind would be absolutely useless at this time. It was the most
inopportune time that could be chosen. The Party was elected by the
people, and they elected a leader, and so they were the direct
representatives of  the people of Ireland today. Having regard to
that, the resolution should be rejected.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael J.Casey - I have great
pleasure in moving that we adopt it. I am firmly convinced that
Ireland is robbed of its youth, its industry and its wealth. The
English have been grinding down Ireland since the days of
Cromwell.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Patrick Sexton - The resolution
is a slap in the face at Mr Redmond and the Irish Party.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Thomas Power - Sinn Fein are
undoubtably good Irishmen in their own estimation, but they go to
extremes. They are not men who are suitable for the present
generation. They may be good, faithful Irishmen in their own way, but
they are not wise Irishmen who look to the future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael Byrne - Ireland would
be a nation today but for the rotten British Government - the dirty
action they took against poor Ireland - and it is no harm to have
them well beaten down. No harm to have them beaten down as we are.
The German Government is far superior to it and -</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Patrick Sexton - All right now.
We can't hear that.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Byrne - Can't hear it? I am not
under a compliment to any Government.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Sexton - Take care and don't
get us into trouble.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">May 1916<BR>

ESCAPED BY THE SKIN OF MY TEETH</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">A resolution was passed by the
Dungarvan Urban Council demanding the release of Daniel Fraher and
Philip Walsh of Dungarvan who were visiting Dublin at the time of the
Easter Rising. They were both arrested.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael J.Casey - I was
spending a few days in Drogheda when the rebellion broke out and I
escaped by the skin of my teeth.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">William Stack - What a pity
(laughter).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran - You couldn't
shoot a crow. A dummy gun would frighten you (laughter).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael Brennock's resolution
condemned the actions of his misguided fellow countrymen and asked
the Government for mercy and magnanimity.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Jul 1916<BR>

DO YOU LIKE TO BE IN THE LIMELIGHT ?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael Curran, 26,a Dungarvan
railway porter, who was now a private in the Irish Guards, had
written to the DUC thanking them for their resolution attacking
Sergeant O'Neill's comments about "corner boys" in the Army. After
being wounded in France he returned to Dungarvan in his uniform.
After references to events in Dublin he was attacked by Daniel
Roynane. He cross examined in court by E.A.Ryan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Do you like to be in the
limelight ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - I don't quite
understand you.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Would you like to be in
public life ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - I would.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Did you go for the Urban
Council in Dungarvan ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - I did.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - And you were defeated
?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - I was, like yourself
when you went for it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Roynane got one month in
jail.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Jul 1916<BR>

ROGER CASEMENT</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael J.Casey proposed
resolution that the King remit the sentence of death on Roger
Casement. Seconded by John Curran. Copy was sent to the Prime
Minister.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Jan1918<BR>

I AM THE PIONEER OF HOUSING IN DUNGARVAN</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Regarding the shortage of
housing in Dungarvan, William Stack said if Mr Power had not vetoed
Mr Curran's proposals there would be 100 extra houses in
Dungarvan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Thomas Power - I am very slow
during my public experience to take notice of every flimsy attack
upon me.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Stack - There's no
attack.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Power - I don't want to boast
about the past, but I take credit for saying that I am the pioneer of
housing in Dungarvan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Stack - Oh, my God ! I did not
know that.</FONT></P>
