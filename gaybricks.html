AND LIMERICK - Jul 1893</b></font></p>
<p>To those seeking a resting place from the toil and labour of the
busy world, to others in search of that precious boon - good health
or to the class of young people who are &ldquo;on pleasure bent&rdquo;
no more agreeable or pleasant location can be found than Dungarvan.
The delightful walks - romantic and picturesque - the bold headlands
of Helvick - the stroll along the sandy beach of the Cunnigar - or
the boating excursion to Balliancourtny and the lighthouse, are
enjoyable incidents in the daily life of our annual visitors.</p>
<p>Year by year as some aged but stalwart peasant from the premier
county finds himself seated at the &ldquo;look out&rdquo; and casting
his eyes seaward fancies himself again young and strong and youthful
as when 50 years before he sat and gazed at the same objects. Perhaps
he hears the stentorian voice of our local Charon which puts the
finishing touch to the realistic picture and he suddenly exclaims - 
&ldquo;Wisha is that Paddy McNamara. Fifty years ago he rowed me to
the Cunnigar.&rdquo; And soon Paddy appears in the flesh, recognises
an old friend from &ldquo;gallant Tip&rdquo; and after many warm
handshakes the renewal of the ancient friendship is sealed by the
visit to R.A.Merry's, the Mecca of the thirsty traveller.</p>
