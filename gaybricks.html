1893</FONT></B></P>

<P>To those seeking a resting place from the toil and labour of the
busy world, to others in search of that precious boon - good health
or to the class of young people who are “on pleasure bent” no more
agreeable or pleasant location can be found than Dungarvan. The
delightful walks - romantic and picturesque - the bold headlands of
Helvick - the stroll along the sandy beach of the Cunnigar - or the
boating excursion to Balliancourtny and the lighthouse, are enjoyable
incidents in the daily life of our annual visitors.</P>

<P>Year by year as some aged but stalwart peasant from the premier
county finds himself seated at the “look out” and casting his eyes
seaward fancies himself again young and strong and youthful as when
50 years before he sat and gazed at the same objects. Perhaps he
hears the stentorian voice of our local Charon which puts the
finishing touch to the realistic picture and he suddenly exclaims -
“Wisha is that Paddy McNamara. Fifty years ago he rowed me to the
Cunnigar.” And soon Paddy appears in the flesh, recognises an old
friend from “gallant Tip,” and after many warm handshakes the renewal
of the ancient friendship is sealed by the visit to R.A.Merry’s, the
Mecca of the thirsty traveller.</P>
