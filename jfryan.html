<EM>Jim Ryan's fellow Town Commissioners laughed at his pretensions but they were all fearful of his tongue and his intelligence. In their eyes he was just a cripple who lived under his father's shadow, but this contempt seemed to have had no affect on Jim's own opinion of himself. Although he probably never achieved much in his life, his son, Arthur Ryan, became one of Dungarvan's most distinguished citizens. </EM><P>

I fear no foe as a Nationalist and Republican.</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Meeting of Town
Commissioners</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan (to James Lynch) - You are
but a boat boy. My father lived here in opulence when you were but a
pauper.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">James Lynch - It was I set your
father up in business.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - You are telling a
lie.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan then attacked M.A.Anthony
saying he was a jobber and owed money.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">M.A.Anthony - Point me out a
single man to whom I owe money. I was a Town Commissioner when a
puppy like you would not be allowed into the room.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Kennefick - I have had long
dealings with Mr Anthony and he does not owe me one penny.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - You are more fortunate
than most.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Lynch - Send for the police and
have the fellow removed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - I fear no foe as a
Nationalist and Republican.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Jan 1881<BR>

I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF MY FRIEND MICHAEL DAVITT</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">James F.Ryan ordered off
platform at Land Meeting at Stradbally attended by 7,000.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Robert Dower (in Chair) - Only
reporters and speakers to the resolution could be on the
platform.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - I am here on behalf of
my friend Michael Davitt and if you object to me here I will get up a
meeting myself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Dower - There is no objection
to you doing so. You will leave if you please.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - I am speaking on behalf
of the National Land League (cheers).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael Walsh, Carrick Castle -
Your name is not on any of the resolutions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - I am here by the
directions of Mr Davitt whose letter I have. If you have an objection
to my addressing the people from the platform I shall address them
from that hill yonder.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">James Power, secretary
Kilrossanty Land League - This platform is my private property and I
order you off it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - You have ordered me off
the platform, the man who has been agitating for your benefit, James
Fitzgerald Ryan of Dungarvan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan then left. Subsequently he
got on a jaunting car and he held forth denouncing one of the
speakers at the meeting.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">(At the next meeting of the
Dungaravan Town Commissioners, when Ryan boasted again about his
connections to Michael Davitt, M.A Anthony said "Mr Davitt knows as
much about you as he does about that ink bottle there.)</FONT></P>

YOU ARE LIKE DEMOSTHENES IN THE JIGS</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Deputation from the Band
Committee attended meeting of Town Commissioners to ask permission to
use the Town Hall for practice. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Thomas O'Conner objected to the
Band using the Town Hall because there was a member of the Royal
Irish Constabulary, Head Constable Brady, on the Band committee.
O'Conner repeated what he heard Father O'Gorman say to the Catholic
Young Men's Society about the R.I.C forty years ago : "Young men
beware of them, for the moment they put on that jacket they put on
the British collar with secret service money in their pockets."
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael.J.Casey moved that the
request be granted.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">James F.Ryan ( to Casey) - You
are a hell of an orator. You are like Demosthenes in the jigs.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - I don't pretend to
-</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Then sit down.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Robert Knowles was objected to
O'Conner's attack on Head Constable Brady.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan ( to Knowles) - When you
are done with your rhapsody I will speak. You are like a Madagascar
monkey in a menagerie.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Mr Chairman and
gentlemen of the Town Commissioners of Dungarvan I as a member of the
Band Committee took the liberty of introducing this deputation and I
stand before you as a member of the committee to oppose this
application mast-head high and to endorse every word that has fallen
from Mr O'Conner's lips. I am 45 years of age. I was born in 1850. I
have been warned since my earliest infancy against the intrigues of
the Royal Irish Constabulary. I am their determined hater and I shall
be to my death bed. I am the grandson of Captain James Fitzgerald -
honest Jas Fitzgerald who built the first slated house in the town of
Dungarvan - and for 750 years my ancestors have lived here. I have
never disgraced them. I am an old Trinity College student and I was
not a dunce. It was by the merest accident that I missed the wig and
gown. As a young man I lived for 6 years in the Australian bush, and
I came here in a sailing ship now lying in the docks. I saw four men
washed overboard and I saw life and death, but of all the sufferings
I ever endured I got it from a fellow member of the Band Committee,
Head Constable Brady, who is here beside me . He looked me up in a
cold cell with 8" of water on the floor. All to keep me from
attending a meeting of the Band Committee.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">After a good deal of shouting
and noise Head Constable Brady started to speak. He denied Ryan's
allegation and then said it was his own idea to start a fund for the
band.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - I deny that. It was in
my brain the idea was pupped.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">James Dunne - I beg your
pardon, I was the man that proposed it. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Dunne also said that at one
time Ryan had referred to Brady as a prince and a gentleman.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Yes, but that was when
he was sucking my brains.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Brady said there was no
necessity for the observations that had fallen from his friend, Mr
Ryan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Your friend? Your
eternal enemy as long as life lasts.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Dec 1895<BR>

RYAN REPORTS POLICEMAN TO THE AUTHORITIES</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">(Edmond O'Shea, the Dunagarvan
correspondant for the Waterford Star, claimed that the Star had sent
a cheque for a &#163;1 to Ryan by mistake and when they asked for it
back he only returned 10s. The cheque should have gone to the Star
Cappoquin correspondent J.F.Ryan. Other accusations he made against
Ryan were that he invited Head Constable Brady into his house for a
drink and then reported him to the authorities for having taken it
and that he borrowed money for horse betting from a bank clerk and
when the clerk asked for his share of the winnings he reported him to
his superior officer for using his employer's money on horse
racing.)</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Jun 1896<BR>

By Jesus, I will make Dublin Castle shake</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan in court for abusive
language to Jack Leahy one of the Moresby rescuers. Ryan claimed
Leahy was threatening him and he went over to constable Corcoren and
said "By Jesus, you won't arrest that ruffian up there; you are one of
Brady's blasted cubs, by Christ if you turn yourself around for a bit
I will knock the blasted face off you. " He then ran into his house
and came out with a bundle of telegraph forms and said to the
constable "By Jesus, I will make Dublin Castle shake."</FONT></P>
