<EM>John Wall's greatest moment arrived when he stood up to the IRA who had control of Dungarvan in 1922. They had come to take the bicycles from his shop but he and his son gave them a taste of their own medicine. Many years before that the Town Commissioners under the control of John Curran had made the mistake of trying to cheat him out of a job. Wall then exposed corruption by the Commissioners and then got himself elected as a Commissioner. He then got John Curran kicked out of the Board of Guardians. </EM>

Wall was doing this out of spite</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Dungarvan Board of
Guardians</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Letter received from John Wall,
Dungarvan, stating that a member of the Board of Guardians, John
Curran, was involved in a contract for straw. Wall had tendered for
the contract and had offered the lowest tender, but the contract went
to Miss O'Brien of Ballymacart. This straw was really supplied by
John Curran. Michael J.Casey said Wall had lost the milk contract
that year and his butter salary was not paid and he was doing this
out of spite.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">A majority of the Guardians
then voted for a sworn enquiry. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran denounced Guardians
who posed as Nationalists upholding British law, which was meant to
oppress and crush the people of this town.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Richard Ussher said he didn't
think it was a compliment to say that if Home Rule became a fact that
they would ignore the passing of laws to prevent wrong doing at
public boards.</FONT></P>

Another contract supplied by a Guardian</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Wall wrote to the
Guardians to say that bacon supplied to the Workhouse by Ellen Walsh
was really supplied by Michael J.Casey. The contact was for &#163;2
3s 4d.</FONT></P>

enquiry.</FONT></P>

I say the people will rise up and hurl you from this room</FONT></B>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">(The Commissioners complained
that Wall's salary (&#163;50) was greater than the revenue from the
butter market, so they closed the council butter premises and refused
to pay Wall's salary. The butter market moved to R.A.Merry's where to
the Commissioner's chagrin it was a great success.)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">James F.Ryan - Is there any
hope of getting our butter market out of Merry's store and getting it
back to our place ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Captain Richard Curran - We
could not pay an impossible salary.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Scanlan - The butter
market is gone and the town is ruined...It is a great shame that the
Board is ruled by the two Currans and Casey.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - They are not going to
wipe out men of intelligence here...My God, your private vengeance
will ruin the town. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan (to John Curran) - I say
the people will rise up and hurl you from this room on account of the
butter market - sending it down amongst a lot of Methodists and psalm
singers at the end of the street (applause). Now let any man get up
and contradict me.</FONT></P>

Manure seized</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Bailiffs, acting for John Wall,
who was owed &#163;12 10s wages by the Town Commissioners, seized
manure that was about to be auctioned by the Commissioners at their
depot.</FONT></P>

He would not submit to the IRA </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">An exciting incident and one which threatened
tragic circumstances occurred at Dungarvan on Monday. It appears that
some members of the IRA stationed at Dungarvan barracks called at the
residence of Mr John Wall, for the purposes of taking way whatever
bicycles he had on his premises...The IRA men entered on the premises
and while searching the house, Mr Wall succeeded in locking two of
them in a room. He then procured his loaded guns, both double
barrels, and went outside the door on armed guard. Soon three lorries
of the IRA came to the vicinity of the place and in military action
took up positions. Mr Wall meanwhile guarded the front of his house
while his son guarded the door. The IRA approached and called on Mr
Wall to submit. He refused to do so. A large crowd gathered around
the place. The military advanced and some alert people called on the
priest and Rev. Father Hearn came on the scene as well as Mr
M.J.Casey and Dr Hacket. It is said but for the intervention of
Father Hearn there would have been bloodshed for one of the IRA had
his revolver presented at Mr Wall ready to fire, while Mr Wall had
him covered with his gun. Father Hearn rushed between them, and with
some dissuasion no shots were fired, but the military arrested Mr
Wall and his son and had them taken to the barracks. With them went
Mr Casey and Dr Hackett and after about half an hours detention they
were released and returned home. Numbers of bicycles, as well as
motor cycles and motor cars, have been commandeered in the town and
taken to the barracks. </FONT></P>
