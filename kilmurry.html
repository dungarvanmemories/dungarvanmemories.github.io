THE PRESENTATION NUNS OF DUNGARVAN AND THEIR ACCUSERS.</FONT></B>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">For some days past large placards on the dead
walls announced that a meeting would be held in the Town Hall,
Dungarvan, on Sunday (yesterday), for the purpose of establishing a
branch of the Irish National League, and that the Rev. Pierce
Casey,P.P.,V.F.,would attend, as well as the other local clergy.   At
the time announced for the meeting a large number of people filled
the hall, amongst those present being -Rev.P. Casey,P.P.,Dungarvan;
Thomas O'Conner,C.T.C.;R.Curran,T.C.; J.Curran,T.C.; ThomasPower,
P.Walsh,T.C.;M.Morrissey,Knockaun; M.Flynn,T.C.; J.Walsh,T.C.; Walsh,
Ballyduff; M.J.Casey,&amp;c.,&amp;c.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">It may be necessary to state that a few weeks
ago Mr P.Walsh, of Kilmurry was evicted from his holding, the
landlords being the Presentation Nuns of Dungarvan,and since the
eviction a number of have appeared in the local papers, all from the
evicted tenant or his friends, and strongly condemning the actions of
the nuns, which are described as cruel and harsh. For some time after
the hall being pretty well filled no move was made for anyone to
constitute the meeting, or propose a chairman. When, after a
considerable time, the Rev.P.Casey walked in the direction of the
permanent stage of the building, followed by some others, there was
loud applause.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> The Rev.Father Casey then standing on the
stage, addressed the meeting. He said - this meeting is a humbug. It
may seem to some persons that I convened this meeting. I did no such
thing. If I did I would take the chair.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A voice - You are welcome.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Rev. gentleman continued - If I were asked
by the people of  this parish, or the quarter part of the people of
this parish, to call the meeting I would do so, because anything they
ask me I will do it (applause). But three gentlemen called upon me to
form a branch of the National League. One was a man that did not
belong to the parish, and I do not know that he is a member of the
League in his own parish, and of the two others I do not know what is
their nationality. I have not been here long enough to know that, but
I saw at once it was a meeting got up to attack the Nuns of the
Presentation Order.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">A voice - The nuns should not be
attacked.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> Rev.P.Casey,P.P. - What is your name , sir?
Will you have a little patience ? Hear me. Will you be able to
conduct yourself till I finish, then you will have plenty of time;
but I do not want to be disturbed by every ragamuffin that comes here
(applause). If you wish you wish you can come up and speak here. If
you don't give me silence I won't go on, but if you give me silence
anyone that wishes to speak after me, I will hear him. I will not
boycott you from hearing him. I am not ashamed of any man. I take my
position here as parish priest and superior of religious orders, to
prevent them from being blackguarded and hunted down, for I am bound
as their pastor and protector, to defend them (applause). If the
statement I make is not true, let any man come forward and contradict
it. The Nuns have been blackguarded in the papers, and it is my duty
to defend them (hear,hear). It is high time to defend them.[...] Now
allow me to ask one question. If there is any farmer that can show me
that his landlord has treated him better than the nuns have treated
Patrick Walsh, let him stand up before me (loud applause). I am not
going to listen to a fellow that idles about the streets, but a
respectable farmer in this room - let him stand up and show me that
his landlord has treated him better than the nuns have treated
Patrick Walsh (renewed applause).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Captain R. Curran - There are men in this room
who were evicted for one half years rent.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Rev.P.Casey,P.P. - And there is nothing in the
papers about it. These nuns received from Patt Walsh for eight years
&#163;194, while during the eight years they had to pay &#163;328
head-rent, thereby losing &#163;150. They gave him permission to go
before Judge Walters, what all the tenants in the county are looking
for, and they gave him permission to break his lease when no landlord
in the country would do so (applause)... He now asked the meeting to
say whether the nuns had treated Patt Walsh harshly or not. Had they
treated him harshly ? (Loud cries of "No.") Did they treat him fairly
? (Loud cries of "Yes.") Now, any person that wishes to make a
statement, I will sit down quietly and listen to him
(applause).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr. M Morrissey (Knockaun) - Rev. Chairman
-</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Rev.P.Casey - I am not chairman you know very
well. I refused to be chairman. You came to me from a strange parish;
you tried to capture me. Why did you come to me ? You are a stranger
in this parish. You had no right to make yourself a hero in this
parish. Why did you come to me ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr Morrissey - Because I am a National Leaguer,
and was always one, and I hope I ever will be. If you want to know my
principles I refer you to the two clergymen of my parish (noise and
excitement).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> Rev.P.Casey - Are you a leaguer in your own
parish ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr Morrissey - I am.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Rev.P.Casey - Is there a branch in your parish
?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr Morrissey - There is.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Rev.P.Casey - You have no branch there at all,
sir.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr Morrissey - We have; but it is
asleep.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Rev.P.Casey - Why not rouse it up then in your
own parish. We can do our business in Dungarvan without going to you.
We don't want your help in Dungarvan to get up a branch (applause and
excitement).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr Morrissey - Were you, rev. sir -</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Rev.P.Casey - I don't want to be dictated to by
you. It is your forte to  be talking about bishops and priests,
blackguarding bishops and priests (much confusion).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr Maurice Flynn,T.C - Perhaps I may ask Mr
Morrissey a question ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr Morrissey - I will not answer the likes of
you sir.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Rev.P.Casey - I tell you what I will do. As
there is not a farmer in the room whose landlord has treated him
better than the nuns have treated Patt Walsh -</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Michael Mullins - Sir, I -</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Rev.P.Casey - Who are you, Sir ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Michael Mullins - I am a labourer, Sir.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Rev.P.Casey - Well, you are not a farmer. I
said a farmer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr Morrissey - I must say, Father Casey, that
you came here to defend the nuns.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Rev.P.Casey - I did come here to defend the
nuns. I do not deny it, and I am bound to defend them, and I have a
good cause (applause and cries of "Turn him out") The nuns have not
been rentrackers. They have been lenient, and they have been
blackguarded in all the papers, before bishops, and priests, and
every person.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr Morrissey - You called on me to speak, and I
am not allowed to speak. That is not justice.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Rev.P.Casey - Say what you have to say.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> Mr Morrissey - When I commenced you stopped me
up.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Rev.P.Casey - You have no right to dictate
here. You are a humbug (cries of "Turn him out" and great
noise).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Here the Rev.P.Casey left the platform followed
by a few friends, while the crowd in the body of the hall cheered and
shouted in the most excited manner.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr M.Flynn asked Mr Morrissey a
question.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr Morrissey - Go along, you scut.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Mr Flynn then left the platform, Mr Morrissey
looking daggers at him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> When Mr Flynn got to the body of the hall Mr
Morrissey addressed him very excitedly, the audience cheering and
hooting, and Mr Morrissey jumped off the platform into the body of
the hall, and advancing to Mr Flynn, faced him in a most determined
attitude. The people, believing he was about to attack Mr Flynn,
rushed on Mr Morrissey and hustled him violently towards the wall.
The scene here was of the most excited description, and several
voices shouted from the platform for the people to be quiet. Mr
Morrissey rushed upstairs on to the platform, and made across it to
the door, and left the hall.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> Capt.R.Curran then came forward, and addressed
the people. He called upon them to sign a requisition to their parish
priest calling on him to form a branch of the National League
(applause). The parish priest had been mislead and consequently felt
annoyed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> A requisition was drawn up by Mr John Curran,
which afterwards was signed by a good number of those present, and,
after a while, the calm which follows the storm prevailed, and the
people dispersed.</FONT></P>

CORRESPONDENCE</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Knockane, January 10th, 1889</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Sir - I ask space in your widely circulated
journal to lay before the public a true account of the late meeting
held in the Town Hall, Dungarvan, on Sunday 6th Inst., and how I got
connected with it. It was Mr. Edward Spratt, of Coolcormack, and I
who first got a branch of the Land League started in Dungarvan...
Mr.Edward Spratt and Mr Maurice Quann, of Dungarvan, induced me to
again take part and to go to the Rev.P.Casey P.P. asking his consent
to renew the Land League in Dungarvan. He received me as friendly as
he did his two parishioners, though he knew very well I was from
another parish. He said he would be very  glad to have it formed, and
that we should get the shopkeepers to join, as it was in their
interest, as much as the farmers; that he would preside, but that
pass no resolutions about "boycotting." ... Father Casey, with some
of the representative men of the town, sat on the front bench
deliberating who would be chairman. I being from another parish did
not interfere. Quite suddenly the P.P. went on to the platform,
followed by his friends. I took my place there too expecting a branch
of the League was about to be formed, and believed at the time the
P.P. had been elected chairman. Father Casey burst suddenly out and
said the meeting was a humbug, got up to blackguard him and in order
to blackguard the nuns. Now I firmly believe either of those two most
respectable, inoffensive parishioners of his or myself would be the
last men in the country to offend or blackguard priests or nuns...
Father Casey tells the public  it is my forte to blackguarding 
bishops and priests. I think it would be only fair and just for
Father Casey to prove that abominable charge, or retract it in the
public press. The public  may not be aware that Father Casey and I
were on very friendly terms before Sunday last, and so late as the
eviction at Kilmurry I went to him, asking him to intervene for
P.Walsh. His answer was : "Michael, if only for your sake, I will do
all I can for him." A day or two afterwards we met again and he told
me the nuns wanted me to become security for the future rent of
Kilmurry, and it would settle the case, but reminded me of the danger
and responsibility of becoming security. The next day I met the P.P.
at the convent. He asked me what I was going to do; I said I had
&#163;100 for the nuns in lieu of Pat Walsh's arrears, and would
become future security for the future rent of Kilmurry. It was then
refused, which clearly shows I was "humbugged," that I was not a
"blackguard." Gentlemen who abstain from National meetings now will
be "respectable men;" but gentlemen who attend them will be
"blackguards." I am glad to see Capt.Curran is a converted
Nationalist, and I hope if a branch is formed he will become
president. Then Dungarvan may be sure the branch will flourish, and
will not be misled.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> Regarding Mr.Maurice Flynn, when he left the
platform he insulted me and invited me down to give me a thrashing. I
accepted his invitation, but somehow he quickly disappeared. I am
told he would have stood his ground only he was afraid of soiling his
"kids." </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial"> I was then left to a number of persons with
Mr.Thomas Queally (Father Casey's brother-in-law) at their head, who
assaulted me - for what reason I cannot tell.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Apologies for trespassing so much on your
valuable space - I am, sir, yours truly, MICHAEL MORRISSEY</FONT>
</P>
