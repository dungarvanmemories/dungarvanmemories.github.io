         <P>Have you ever stood on the old bridge of a summer evening
         when the full spring tide swept up to the quays, and the
         fishing boats swayed gently on its dark green waters ? Have
         you ever watched the sun setting on the old church of
         Abbeyside, and while you loved to see the dim ruin
         illuminated by its lingering glory, have you ever thought of
         how it has set just here every evening since those far off
         days when you native town was a home of peace and plenty;
         when workers moved in thousands through it’s busy streets
         and merchant ships laden with foreign freight swept proudly
         onto its shores and took our produce in exchange for their
         treasure ?&nbsp;

</TABLE><P>How many generations have come and gone, how many changes
have passed over the Old Borough since Cromwell’s destroying armies
shattered the Monastery and Castle of Abbeyside and Nano Nagle filled
her cup of ale for the conquering tyrant ? There are some who may
consider her action as one of cowardice for begging even the
slightest favour from a cruel enemy, yet surely she must have been a
brave women who could approach such a man as Cromwell with a plea for
mercy on her lips, and one cannot help wondering if another Cromwell
were to ride through the streets today which of us would be the
first to appeal to him for the sake of our native town.</P>

<P>Comparisons they say are odious, and what is the use of looking
back to the past either in empty pride or in vain regret for what can
never be again ? But are we so sure of this, and is Dungarvan to
remain for ever indifferent, its people dwindling away be emigration,
its energy arrested, its trade declining, and nothing for its future
inhabitants but the inevitable oblivion of a degenerate people ? No,
we cannot, will not allow this to happen, and not even the gloomiest
pessimist could think so who had spent a summer holiday in the Old
Borough. The streets, it is true, are badly kept, the houses old and
shabby, while the corn-stores on the quay a while ago echoed to the
hum of busy workers are fast crumbling to ruin. The fish hawkers that
once plied a vigorous trade are now few and needy, for the fish even
seem to have deserted the neighbouring waters. There are no big
factories and few vessels for a harbour town. Decay seems slowly
creeping everywhere. Yet with all this we know there is life and hope
and promise for the coming generations of Dungarvan. Life there is in
the fervent glowing faith which is still there own, unshaken by long
sorrow and persecution, and now emerging strong in its knowledge of
the truth which shall never fade from the Irish race. Life and hope
there is, too, in the young men and women of the town, with the
vigour of health and the bloom of health about them, and in the rosy
cheeked, happy children who flock out of school every evening -
careless, glad, merry, with bright eyes and sweet faces and graceful
young limbs hurrying homeward. What town, indeed, would not be proud
to possess them ?&nbsp;</P>

<P>Now, walk down the Main street and on to the little park over the
sea and what will you find there on this glorious summer afternoon ?
Groups of strangers sitting on the stiff benches chatting merrily as
they gaze over the placid waters that stretch to that pleasure ground
of summer romance - the Cunnigar, and then beyond its sandy hills to
the village of Ballingoul and the cottages at Helvick, resting under
the shadow of its own fair headland. Nothing much, you may say, in
all this. No tall mountains and green valleys between, no bold rocks
and sandy coves, nor bits of wild scenery to charm the artistic
fancy. Only the great blue sea flowing out to the great wide ocean -
behind is the little town surrounded by hills of varying purple and
golden colours, a park with ill-kempt grass, with no scent of flowers
nor waving of noble trees, looking on one side of to an old ruined
abbey and on the other to a long grassy peninsula with a tiny fishing
hamlet beyond it, at our feet the murmur of the waves, above us a
grey or blue sky according to the fickle mood of the weather, and yet
why does the tide of summer visitors increase year by year, and what
is the charm that brings them to this quiet unfashionable resort ?
Perhaps its very quietness holds the attraction or the perfect freedom
which the reign of summer seems to bring to Dungarvan, or it may be
the pleasure of crossing in those sturdy rowing boats and trying a
hand at one of the oars, or learning to swim in the easy calm waters
near the shore, or is it the devotion of morning Mass or evening
service in the Friary Chapel, or the magic of the band promenade in
the tiny park, or the pleasant ways of the townspeople and their soft
speech with so many expressions borrowed from the language they have
done their best to disregard ? Or is it all these things together
that makes Dungarvan such a successful watering place ? I know not
indeed what the answer may be for strangers but if you who are
natives wish to solve the riddle you must go away a while to live in
exile and then come back in the midst of summer. Walk through the
town down to the sea with you eyes and ears and heart open for all
they are seeking. Look across the heaving waters and see the beauty
that summer showers alike on ruined castle and purple-sided hill,
breath long and deeply of your grand native air, listen to the voices
of the sea and the wind, and to those of the children and men and
women around you, and now do you not feel at last the magic
irresistible charm that lurks by every stone and breathes through
every sound and lives in every heart within Dungarvan.</P>
