<EM>Matty Walsh was a grabber. He took on the tenancy of farms from which the previous tenant had been evicted. These farms had been boycotted by the Land League and consequently the grabbers were ostracized. Unlike many grabbers, who just pulled up the drawbridge, bided their time for a few decades and then emerged as prosperous gentleman farmers, Matty drew his sword and went out looking for his enemies. No matter what his tormentors tried they could never crush him and he ended up as one of the biggest landowners in West Waterford. </EM><P>

where he could see him.</FONT></P>

back. The nearer I am to you the better you will hear me.</FONT></P>

police, and they won't remove me. Who made you Chairman? It is a
disgrace to have you Chairman of the Town Commissioners.</FONT></P>

bought it over my head. You did, you traitor. I won't give you
possession or anyone else. I could not be treated worse than I am.
You broke your word not once but twice, and you have treated me
badly. What am I going to say. "Non ego", yes, and "Non Peccavi." I
have not sinned, but you have betrayed me twice, and you are worse
than Judas.</FONT></P>
