<P><FONT SIZE="+2">Michael Byrne</FONT></P>

<EM>Michael Byrne is well known for his attempts  to improve conditions for the Workhouse inmates. Although he was a working man, a stevedore, he was always an independant man who regarded himself as the equal of any man in Dungarvan.</EM><P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Jan 1907<BR>

HE IS NOT A TRAMP. HE BELONGS TO THE TOWN.</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Debate at Board of Guardians
about the admission to the Waterford District Asylum of a patient
named Michael Grady. The Master of the Workhouse Thomas Walsh said he
was a tramp and had been in the workhouse nine days. The Waterford
District Asylum said he had been admitted suffering from scabies and
was verminous.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Byrne - He is not a tramp. He
belongs to the town.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Matthew Walsh - The Master says
he is a tramp.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Byrne - He is not a tramp. He
went to school with Patrick Kelly, a member of our board, and
myself.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Jan 1907<BR>

WE ARE GUARDIANS OF THE POOR</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Byrne - I say we are here as
guardians of the poor and they should be looked after.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Jan 1907<BR>

THIS HOUSE WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE A PRISON</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">There was a rule of the Local
Government Board that the infirm who were unable to work should not
have access to the farm attached to the workhouse. Michael Byrne
complained about this rule and had it rescinded in Dungarvan.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Byrne - This house was never
meant to be a prison. I hold that the old infirm people ought to have
the use of the farm.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">May 1909<BR>

STRICKEN DOWN BY THE DEAD</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">James Hennessey, mason, wrote
the to DUC asking for compensation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">In February 1908 a sewer was
open when I was lifting a very heavy flag in a stooping position. A
funeral was passing and I was called to stop by several persons and I
did not hear them, when I was suddenly stricken down, in my opinion,
by the dead, as I was crushed in the sewer...I would thank the Board
to grant me the small amount of &#163;20. I think I am insured under
the late Town Clerk.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Patrick Sexton - Shall we take
any action on this letter?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael Byrne - Not at all
(laughter).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Patrick Foley - Tell him we are
not accountable for the actions of the dead.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran - Tell him we have
no funds. If we had we would give him something.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael Byrne - Maybe he is
entitled to get compensation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">William Stack - Yes, maybe he
is, and you the labour candidate here was the first to speak against
him. You are the labour representative. Why don't you stand up and
talk for him (laughter)?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael Byrne - I move that he
get &#163;20 (laughter).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Jan 1911<BR>

HE LIKED TO PLEASE THESE OLD MEN</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael Byrne was against
giving the Workhouse milk contract to the Shandon Dairy Co. Mr Egan,
Ballygegan, the old contractor, had always given them satisfaction.
He had heard the old men in the house praising the milk they were
getting before, and he liked to please these old men and give the
paupers the best of food.</FONT></P>
