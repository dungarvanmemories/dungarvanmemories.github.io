<EM>I originally thought that M.J.Casey was called "The Bruiser" because of his tendency to get into fights. But I was told it was because if you did a business deal with him you came away bruised. Despite this an old man I met from Kilrossanty who remembered M.J.Casey said he was very generous to the poor people of that area. "The Bruiser" was a man of great independence who cared little for the opinions of others. His shop at 8 Main St had all its windows smashed by a mob who took exception to his opposition to Arthur Ryan's candidacy in the 1911 Parliamentary election. He was the brother of Father Richard Casey. </EM><P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">FEB 1886<BR>

Town Commissioners fail in their attempt to replace M.J.Casey with
Tom Power </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Thomas Power wrote thanking
members of the board who had elected him a Town Commissioner, but
stating that he would not stand in the way of Mr Casey, who was a
personal friend.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Casey - He won't stand in my
way for I am here, and I would like to see the man who would put me
out. (Laughter)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Chairman (Maurice Flynn) - Do
you accept this resignation ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Tomas O'Conner - There was
no vacancy at the board at all. Mr Casey was legally elected, and
those who elected Mr Power were only making fools of themselves and
making a fool of him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr John Curran (to the
chairman) - Are you taking any action with regard to Mr Casey?</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Chairman - What action can I
take ? I am doing nothing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Curran - He came into the
room a while ago and you would not hold the meeting, as you did not
recognise him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Casey - That was the way at
the Poor Law Board yesterday, when they boycotted the meeting.</FONT>
</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">MAY 1886<BR>

That looks like an advertisment for a wife</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr M J Casey, bread contractor,
wrote to say that the Guardian's cheques were still dishonoured, and
at present there was &#163;370 due to him from the Guardians. Unless
some provision were made for payment within a month, he would be
obliged to instruct his solicitor to proceed against them for the
amount.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Patrick Walsh - That looks
like an advertisement for a wife. Why there is no young lady in the
country would refuse to marry a man that could afford to give such
large credit (laughter).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">JUN 1886<BR>

Hold your tongue now, slippery Dick.</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Captain Gibbons - The Harbour
Master was of the opinion that I was saying things behind his
back.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Casey - It is a foregone
conclusion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Chairman (Mr Maurice Flynn) -
Mr Casey, if you please whatever remarks you have to make address
them to the chair. If not I must call you to order.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Casey - I hope you are not
put in that position to do so, Mr Chairman. If you do you are
mistaken.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Chairman - I must call you to
order. [...] Perhaps the public do not now that Mr Casey is my
brother-in-law. I must distinctly state that or sometimes I will be
in a false position. The boy is young. He requires a little
castigation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Richard Phelan said they
should proceed regularly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Casey - Hold your tongue
now, slippery Dick (laughter).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Captain Gibbons - ..they should
get a skilled engineer from Cork.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Casey said their own
engineer was a skilled engineer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Captain Gibbons-There are
engineers and there are engineers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Casey - And there are
Captains and Captains (laughter).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">During the discussion Mr Phelan
and Mr McCarthy were whispering.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Casey - No whispering. It is
not right.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr McCarthy - I beg your
pardon, were you addressing me ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Casey - No, my lord
(laughter).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">JUL 1886<BR>

I have travelled the world, and Mr Casey is the greatest bully I ever
saw</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Captain Gibbons - I have
travelled the world, and Mr Casey is the greatest bully I ever saw;
but his bullying won't put me down.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Phelan - ...It would be hard
for you to keep Mr Casey quiet when the County Court Judge could not
do so. (Laughter)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Casey - Oh, the House League
will settle you.(Loud laughter). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Chairman (Mr M Flynn) - Order,
Mr Casey.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Phelan - I wonder you can't
conduct yourself in civilised society.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Casey - You are not able to
conduct yourself.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Chairman - I call you to order
Mr Casey. I will allow no personalities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Casey - You allowed
personalities a while ago; and I see Captain Gibbons grinning and
sneering over there like a pet fox (loud laughter).</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">JULY 1886<BR>

You are beyond control</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Captain Kirby ( to Casey) - You
are beyond control.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Casey - You are beyond
control.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Captain Kirby, at this stage in
the proceedings walked hurriedly across the room to where Mr Casey
was sitting, seized him by the collar of the coat, and pulled him
back against the wall. Several Commissioners intervened to keep
order. The Chairman called for order several times. Captain Kirby was
prevailed upon to cease hostilities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Captain Kirby, on returning to
his seat, made an observation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Casey - You commenced it,
you old dog, but I will teach you manners.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Captain Kirby - When I catch
you out I will teach you manners.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Chairman - Take your seat Mr
Casey.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Casey - I will go to the
police barracks and swear information against him. Mr Casey then
retired.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Captain Kirby - I suppose he
wants to boss the whole board, but if I were to know the remarks that
he made about me outside, I would make him - the mean low fellows
that sent him here are worse.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Casey soon after returned
and said he had lodged information.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">DEC 1887<BR>

WHAT RIGHT HAD YOU TO GO UPSTAIRS ?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael J.Casey arrested and
tried at County Court for maliciously wounding Michael Murphy. Casey
had sacked Murphy, a baker, who had then gone up to Casey's bedroom
above the shop to see him. Casey had then struck Murphy with a poker
causing him to fall down the stairs. Murphy nearly died.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey (in court to Murphy) -
What right had you to go upstairs ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Judge Andrews - He had as much
right as you had to hit him on the head with the poker.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey found not guilty.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">DEC 1892<BR>

There were 15 gentlemen on the jury and 14 agreed to sign the
paper</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">An inquest today was also held
on the body of James Brien and from the evidence it appears the
deceased had some drink taken and was proceeding home when he fell
across the cutting of the waterworks now in progress. One leg went
into the cut and the deceased lay in that position till assisted to
his home close by. This was about 9 o'clock. He drank a cup of tea
and went to bed as usual. During the night he was discovered to be
dead in bed. Drs Holland and Hacket gave it as their opinions that
death resulted from cerebral congestion which might have been
accelerated by his having fallen into the drain although there were
no outward marks to show that he had received any injury from the
fall. The jury added a rider to their verdict censuring the
waterworks contractor, Mr Edward Finn, for having the drain open
without lights or protection. Mr Michael Joseph Casey, the foreman of
the jury, disagreed with their finding and refused to sign the same
paper. A scene occurred. Head Constable Brady who was in charge of
the inquest applied for a warrant for the arrest of the contractor,
but the magistrates would not see their way to grant the application.
As there were 15 gentlemen on the jury and 14 agreed to sign the
paper a verdict in accordance with the medical testimony was brought
in.</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">&nbsp;</FONT></B>

SHOE BOY, BUMBAILIFF, WRETCH</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Court case brought against
Michael J.Casey by J.Mooney.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mooney said Casey was a rather
excitable gentleman. He danced around Mr Mooney calling him a "shoe
boy",a "bumbailiff", a "wretch" and other offensive
expressions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mooney had gone to inspect the
Town Commissioner's books and Casey had confronted him. The Town
Commissioners had signed a resolution saying Mooney was inspecting
the books at an unreasonable hour (8.45 am) and saying he had
insulted Mr Casey when questioned.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">J.F Williams ( to Casey) - Did
Mr Mooney put himself in a position to box (laughter) ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - He put himself in a
form to fight.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Williams - Did he have his
overcoat on ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - He had ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Williams - Did he close his
fists ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - He had his hands in his
pockets (laughter).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey fined &#163;10 and bound
to the peace for a year.</FONT></P>

Using the Town Butter market to store his own goods</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Dungarvan Town
Commissioners</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">J.F.Ryan ( to Casey) - The
ratepayer's money is going in your pocket. Go pay for a store.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Thomas O'Conner - Who has the
keys - Mr Casey ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - I have no keys.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Town Clerk - There are
complaints that the keys cannot be found.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Casey, you have the
cheek to come up here from the Comeraghs and put the keys of the Town Hall
in your pocket.</FONT></P>

I WILL CIVILISE YOU</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Meeting of the United Irish
League</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr William Stack hoped now
there would be no more personalities in the branch. They should all
forgive and forget.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">M.J.Casey - Hear, hear.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Stack - There is a Home Rule
Bill coming and if we do not look to ourselves others will tear the
clothes off our backs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - Ryan wants to boss the
whole county.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Chairman (James Hayes) - Shut
up, Casey.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Casey - I won't. This fellow
wants to boss us.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Hayes - You were expelled from
this branch before, mind.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - If you interfere with
me I will expel you. If you interfere with me -</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Hayes - You are out of
order.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Casey - I don't care about
you and your order.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Hayes - Take care, my boy, or I
will have you expelled again.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - I will civilise you, I
promise you, my boy.</FONT></P>

LET MR DE VELARA COME AND GO</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Meeting of the Dungarvan Urban
Council</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">At the close of business Mr
Michael O'Mahony, Vice Chairman of the council, referring to the
coming visit of Mr De Valera to the town on Tuesday next said as this
was Mr De Valera's first visit to Dungarvan, he thought it would be
fitting for the members of the Urban Council to present an address of
welcome.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">M.J.Casey - I am sorry
gentlemen; we had Black and Tans and murder and bloodshed long
enough, and I move a direct negative to Mr O'Mahony's proposition,
that we do not present an address. We want peace and prosperity in
our country.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">O'Mahony - We ought to pay an
address to him as a distinguished gentleman.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - We want no more trouble
or murder or bloodshed. We want no more Black and Tans. Look at the
enlightenment given us by the Bishops of Ireland.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">O'Mahony - Every man is
entitled to his own opinion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - Let Mr De Valera come
and go.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr O'Mahony made some further
remark which was inaudible, as the members were at the time rising in
their places and filing out of the council chamber without discussing
the matter further or taking any action on the motion.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Nov 1922<BR>

I WILL DO MY DUTY</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">The Town Clerk, Mr O'Mahony,
told the members of Dungarvan Urban Council that he was refusing to
draw up a juror's list.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Town Clerk (taking his hat) - I
won't sit here any longer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Casey (hitting the table) -
I will do my duty. I am a strong supporter of the Free State
Government, and any officer who will not carry out his duties and
instructions and directions of the Free State Government and the
ratepayers will be dealt with.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mar 1923<BR>

HAVE YOU ANY PLUCK ?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Meeting of the Dungarvan Urban
Council</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">The acting clerk, Mr O'Meara,
said he had received the demand from the County Council. The amount
demanded this year was &#163;3,5557. It  meant an increase of about
3/6 in the &#163; for poor rate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">M.J.Casey - A very nice Easter
gift, gentlemen. I think some steps should be taken to protest
against this waste of money. The idea of giving salaries and bonuses
in such times is most uncalled for conduct on the part of any public
body. I care not about anyone, and I say there is a very strong
feeling outside against the present increase of rates, and I say
there should be a meeting of the ratepayers called and a deputation
sent on to Dublin to take some steps in this matter.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Thomas McCarthy - They give
bonuses to the officials all right and nothing to the working
men.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - They'll give them dry
bread and black tea, and the others champagne and three-star brandy
(laughter). Have you any pluck ? I will move a resolution condemning
this conduct, and calling upon the members of the County Council who
voted for this waste of money to resign...There is only a small
section - five or six paltry  ratepayers - members of the county
council who are squandering the rates to pay bonuses to already
overpaid officials. While they job away the money they give the
working man starvation, and it is high time to put an end to this
jobbery.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - Do you refuse to take
that resolution ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Chairman (Michael Brenock) -
Certainly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Casey - Then leave the
chair.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Chairman - No; I will not. And
let me tell you, sir, that you are not living in the Black and Tan
regime at present.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - Then I will move that
you leave the chair.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Chairman - Is the business
finished Mr O'Meara ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - It is not.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Casey then proceeded to
write a resolution, and while doing so the Council began discussing
other business, so that calm and peace were restored, and the meeting
concluded without further reference being made to the subject of the
discussion above reported.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000"> ( The above was one of the
last meetings of the Dungarvan Urban Council that M.J.Casey attended.

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Aug 1923<BR>

REFUSAL TO DIG A GRAVE</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">As an instance of the bitter
feeling owing to the strike in Dungarvan the Transport Workers
refused to dig the grave for the interment of the late Mr M.J.Casey.
When this became known many volunteers came to the rescue and that
night Mr P.McGrath (Manager, reps of M.Flynn's), M.Clancy, merchant,
and F.Phelan, Phelan's Hotel, proceeded to dig the grave. They had it
finished by morning. At the interment these citizens assisted by
others from the town and district covered the grave in an expeditious
manner. The refusal to dig the grave has caused an uneasy feeling
among the people.
