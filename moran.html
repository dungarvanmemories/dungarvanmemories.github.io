<EM>Josie Moran was attacked by Thomas Lee, who became a Town Councillor in the 1950's, for bravely marching through the streets of Dungravan waving a Union Jack. She also showed her pluck in court. Her questioner, Arthur Ryan, the son of James F.Ryan, stood for Parliament in the 1910 election. I would like to know what became of Josie.</EM><P>

I WILL SHOUT "UP WITH THEM" TO THE DAY I DIE.</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Josie Moran, 18, and about 16
other girls around the same age marched around Dungarvan at about
10pm on the 12th July 1917 waving the red, white and blue flag. One
of the girls was dressed in the Army uniform. They shouted "Up with
the khaki" and "Up with the red, white and blue." Thomas Lee attacked Josie Moran and left her in a pool of blood. Lee was then taken to court.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">A.E.Ryan (defending Lee)
addressed some remarks to one of the girls who accompanied
Moran.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Moran - Question me and don't
mind any other girl.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">A.E.Ryan asked Moran if she had
been jeering at the people in the streets.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Moran - My brother was shot in
a German prison and I have a right to shout for him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Here the plaintiff began to cry
in the witness box and kept sobbing for several minutes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Just contain yourself
for a moment. I take it that you were shouting through the
town.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Moran - I had a brother who
died for me and died for England. This boy came and knocked me
down.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Did the police tell you
to go home ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Moran - They did. I told you
that a hundred times before and I won't tell you again.They told us
to go home because they knew we would be beaten by the Sein Feiners.
They had sticks in their hands. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">She said Lee had kicked her in
the side and in the stomach and ran away when he had done the
harm.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - You came here to the
courthouse limping. Were you skipping yesterday ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Moran - No. I wasn't skipping.
Do you want to see my leg ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - I don't want to see your
leg at all (laughter). Do you think that the fathers, husbands and
brothers of these women out at the front would be pleased with this
making a disgrace of yourselves in the town of Dungarvan ? Do you
think you are helping their cause by this sort of conduct ?</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Moran - I will shout "Up with
them" till the day I die.</FONT></P>
