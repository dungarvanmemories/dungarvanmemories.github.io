<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Letter to the Waterford
Citizen</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">I cannot open your paper
without a feeling of dread that the Dungarvan Town Commissioners have
had a meeting...They are poor ignorant bores who go to the meetings
well primed with Strangman's beer or Dower's porter, and mistake
vulgarity for manliness, course vituperation for wit...Is such a
state of things to last for ever, and are the weekly meetings of that
body to be the usual weekly source of shame, disgust and sorrow to
Irishmen at home and abroad ? Yours B.A.J.M Mexborough</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">GER OUT, YOU SCAMP !<BR>

Jan 1882</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Some Town Commissioners were
not happy with the work of Breary, the Borough Surveyor.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">James Lynch (to Breary) - You
will be dismissed my good fellow.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Breary - Ger out, you scamp
!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Lynch - Do you hear what he
says to me ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Thomas O'Conner (Chairman) -
What ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Lynch - Get out of this you
scamp.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">O'Conner - I ask the Borough
Surveyor to make an apology.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Breary refused to do so and
walked out of the room.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Lynch - I will ask for his
instant dismissal. I won't take an apology.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">A THREAT OF TYPHOID<BR>

Jan 1882</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Dr Henry Anthony said the town
sewers were so bad that there was a threat of typhoid.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">James F.Ryan - You will soon
have the plagues of Egypt in the town before long. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Scanlan said there was
nothing in Dr Anthony's report and he was opposed to spending any
money on the sewers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan ( to Scanlan) - You have
ripped up every old house in the town.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Scanlan - If I have I have also
improved the town.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Scanlan handed in a resolution
saying no work should be done on the main sewer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan said Scanlan's resolution
was handed in too late and was illegal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Scanlan - Oh, you and your law
are not worth bothering about.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">After an argument, the
Chairman, Thomas O'Conner, left the room and Ryan took his role.
Scanlan then left.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan said the lives of people
were at stake and he was prepared to sign any cheques that would get
the work done (hear, hear). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Now, gentlemen, I want
to know where is that notice of motion handed in a while ago on a
dirty slip of pass book. It is contrary the usages of any respectable
public body to have its members hand in notices written on soiled
slips of paper, and thenceforward it will be the duty of the
presiding chairman to refuse all notices not written on superfine
cream laid note paper (hear, hear). Where is that despicable little
notice, the outcome of that little man who has just left, for I
believe it is the unanimous wish of the board that it should be
consigned to everlasting flames.</FONT></P>

An edifying spectacle at Dungarvan. Threats to smash one another's
faces</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Thomas Maloney ( to John
Curran) - You are the biggest jobber here, Johnny, and you know
it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">M.J.Casey - You are a drunken
scoundrel Mahoney.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Thomas Quinlan - If you don't
hold your tongue Casey I will expose you.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - What can you expose -
go on.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Quinlan ( to Casey who was
sitting by the fire) - I don't think you are in your place. Come down
here.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - I don't won't to deal
with drunken brutes like you (sensation) ... I am sorry to see a
respectable man like you, Mr Maloney under the influence of liquor as
you are tonight.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mahoney - You are a liar sir. I
am able to conduct myself as well as any member ... I am sorry I did
not bring my stick (laughter).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Two men were introduced into
the boardroom who were looking for work - Wall and Leahy. The men
refused to leave and were chucked out by the Hall Porter and Town
Clerk.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">The uproar at his point was
tremendous. Mr Casey and Mr Quinlan were engaged in an exciting
discussion. Quinlan called Casey a low cur. Casey said he would send
for the police to get Quinlan removed. Quinlan said it was only for
he had respect for those present he would smash his face. Casey ran
to the door as Quainlan approached and called loudly for the
police.</FONT></P>

CUT HEADS AND BLOODY NOSES</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Letter to the editor</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">In looking through the streets
of this town on Friday evening last my attention was drawn to a crowd
of people outside the Town Hall. I made enquiry of what was the cause
of the people being congregated there and I was told a most
scandalous row had taken place in the Town Commissioner's room and
that some of the combatants had cut heads and bloody noses. I
enquired who the fighting Commissioners were and was informed they
were Messrs John Cullinan, Edmond McCarthy, Thomas Quinlan and
Michael J.Casey etc. I was further informed that it was only by some
miraculous intervention that some of the Commissioner's necks were
not broken by a Commissioner flinging those Commissioners down the
stairs as he had threatened to do in a most violent manner.WN</FONT>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Nov 1893<BR>

A terrible Uproar. Hostilities renewed at Dungarvan</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">As the time approached for
holding the meeting a lively interchange of the usual complements
incidental to meetings of the body took place, and such expressions
as "I hope you are not drunk tonight, Tom" and "Here comes Johnny the
Jobber" were freely indulged in. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Cullinane proposed that
Edmond McCarthy take the Chair. Thomas Quinlan seconded the motion.
John Curran proposed Michael J.Casey. This was supported by another
member. The Town Clerk said he would sit in the Chair until it was
properly decided who should be Chairman. Here one member seized the
Chair and an excited scuffle took place...The Chair being the prized
object for which the Councillors fought on this occasion it was
roughly handled and the article of furniture in question, although of
great historical antiquity, was not proof against the efforts of the
irate Councillors so it collapsed and fell asunder, the back falling
on the fire. The excitement was becoming intense at this stage and
each member came to the support of his own friends. The squabble thus
became a general engagement, one member delivered a right hander at
his neighbour which missed its work, but landed on the mouth of a
peacemaker behind, who was at once transformed into a belligerent,
and went for his opponent to such purpose that he landed him under
the Town Clerk's desk in the corner of the room, where he was
protected from further injury by the rear guard of the attacking
force. Meanwhile to the consternation of the officials, who
endeavored to protect the corporate property, the chair caught fire.
The Town Clerk immediately rushed into the lower end of the room,
caught the chair in his arms, and after battling with the flames for
some time succeeded in preserving the remnant of that antique and
interesting seat of wisdom, learning and politeness for the benefit
of posterity. Still the battle raged between the contending parties.
The gentleman who drew the first blood was protected by his friends
while the gore poured from his adversary's mouth, who made frantic
efforts to get within striking distance. At last an opening was
found. The top-coat of an aged member was used as a shield to protect
the man under the desk, and although the blows fell fast and furious,
yet the owner of the said top-coat being accustomed to run the
blockade, defended his friend with such tact that not a single blow
reached its object until the attacking party observing a split in the
tail of the coat let this opponent have a thumper between the eyes,
and knocked him all of a heap under the desk. Blood poured from the
wound copiously. This was the signal for general melee. One gentleman
who fancied the Commissioners indulged in the luxury of a tongs,
rushed to the fire-place in search of that article, which failing to
discover he did the next best thing under the circumstances, and
seized hold of that useful requisite, the poker, which stood alone in
the corner like the solitary sparrow on the house top moaning at the
parsimony of the municipal legislators having failed to provide it
with a suitable companion in the shape of a decent tongs. Other
members of the body took the tip and also rushed to the fireplace,
but as the poker had already been monopolised, nothing remained but a
seven ounce cut glass ink bottle, which was eagerly laid hold of for
the purposes of offense or defence as the exigencies of the occasion
might require. But the gentleman who took forcible possession of the
poker had scarcely time to congratulate himself on his good fortune
in securing such an admirable means of enforcing his opinions when he
was seized by the throat and received an unmerciful shaking from a
colleague who reminded him that on a former occasion he nearly came
to grief by a rather free indulgence in the use of the poker. The
knight of the fire iron fought hard to retain his prize, but at
length owing to the strain of the contest the shirt buttons gave way,
and the remnant of what has been classically described by a famous
writer as a "Tommy" fell to the floor. "I have you at last," said the
hero of the poker, "I will make you pay for that." But whether the
that referred to the mutilated "Tommy" or the shaking, must remain a
mystery until the majesty of the law which has been invoked, throws
more light on the subject... When the smoke of battle had cleared
during a momentary pause in the fight someone called out that the man
under the desk was "kilt" while another tremendous "smasher" was
descending on his devoted head, when Mr Michael Beary, Borough
Surveyor, seeing that the matter was becoming serious threw himself
into the breach, seizing the uplifted hand of the attacking party and
averted the stroke which, if delivered, might have the melancholy
effect of altering the comparative "kilt" into the superlative killed
in less time than it takes to transcribe these lines. A member of the
body here ventured to suggest that the police should be called in to
put an end to the disturbance. Meanwhile, Michael J.Casey took
possession of what remained of the chair and suggested that they
should go on with the business...</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">At the close of the business on
investigating the casualties the following was the result : John
Curran, forehead badly bruised, abrasion on nose, John Cullinane,
three teeth injured, lip damaged, Michael J.Casey, "Tommy" and tie
fearfully mangled, shirt buttons dislocated. Corporate property
injured : one mahogany armchair partially destroyed by fire, one
folding screen burned, one bottle of ink spilled. We failed to
ascertain the number of hats blocked or top coats injured in the
"scrimmage." WN</FONT></P>

HIS GRINDERS WERE ALL PERFECT AND FIT FOR ACTION AT ANY MOMENT</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">There were complaints about Dungarvan Town Commissioners using resolutions of condolences to make personal points. While ostensibly seconding a resolution one Commissioner said it was a mistake to say he had 3 teeth knocked out of him at the last meeting. His "grinders" were all perfect and fit for action at any moment</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Oct 1895<BR>

WE HAVE CLEARED THE RUBBISH FROM THE BOARD</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Edmond Keohan, Chairman of the
DungarvanTown Commissioners, read the following letter.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Sir, We the undersigned Town
Commissioners beg to tender you our resignations as members of your
board...It was the earnest requests of the priests and influential
townsmen that we consented to act as Commissioners for the sake of
purifying the board and to put an end to the scenes that have
disgraced our town, and make it the byword of reproach. Our object
had almost been completed when certain members were elected at the
last election in preference to gentlemen who were nominated in the
interests of peace and harmony...Now that these gentlemen, about whom
the Local Government Board wrote that they were instituting legal
proceedings as the result of a sworn enquiry held into their conduct
as guardians of the poor, are now back as Commissioners, we deem it
our imperative duty, both as a protest against the action of those
responsible for their election as well as for the sake of our
characters, to discontinue being members of your board - signed
Thomas Quinlan, Thomas Flynn, John Mooney, Thomas Power, Edmond
O'Shea, Francis Stuart and Michael Barry.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">After the letter was read out
Messers Curran, Casey and O'Conner clapped their hands with
vehemence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Thomas O'Conner - I now propose
that their resignations be accepted.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran - I second
that.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">O'Conner - We have cleared the
rubbish from the Board - not only the rubbish, Mr Chairman, but the
rotten rubbish. A more insulting document was never read.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran - Did Frank Stuart
and Johnny Walsh think they could get rid of the men true to the old
name of Captain Richard Curran ? The name Curran will never die in
the town, and the day will never come that the name Curran will not
be at every public board in Dungarvan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">The new members co-opted on to
the Board were Edmond Cashin, James F.Ryan, John Daniel, Edward
McCarthy, John Scanlan, Michael Foley and John Butler.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">(Edmond O'Shea, who had just
resigned as a Town Commissioner but continued to attend the meetings
as the Dungarvan correspondent for the Waterford Star, wrote "It is
well that the ratepayers ( blind, foolish, invertebrate and with
neither the will nor desire to discriminate) who are answerable for
this latest infusion of boisterous new blood, should have so speedily
got reason to realise ( if possible) their incredible folly.")</FONT>

EXCUSE ME, GENTLEMEN, I HAVE LOST MY TEETH</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Thomas O'Conner (referring to
the TC's who resigned ) - Mr Chairman says they were good men, these
runaways, this pack of know nothings, this pack of scribblers that
have left this board - excuse me, gentlemen, I have lost my
teeth.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Your heart is all
right.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">O'Conner - They are now back on
their knees asking to be let back on the board, but they will be gone
forever as long as O'Conner is in Dungarvan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - I saw Dungarvan
placarded in London - "Terrible scenes at Dungarvan" - and all the
disgrace is brought on the town by one man for a few shillings. I saw
him a pot boy at the monk's school and I say -</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Edmond O'Shea - If you refer to
me, Mr Ryan, the people of Dungarvan know me better and respect me
better than they do you. If you were worth taking an action against I
would take it. You have only a few shillings a week for minding the
shop.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - You are lying,
Sir.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">O'Shea - You are not worth an
action and the only thing to do is to break your face (confusion and
noise).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Keohan resigned as Chairman and
the meeting broke up in disorder.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">We saw on Sunday Mr Tom
O'Conner and Mr J.F.Ryan in the park, if not hatching treasons and
stratagems at least as thick as pickpockets. As before, we shudder to
prophesy the time when they will be at one another's throats.</FONT>

SCRUBBERS NAMES WIPED OUT</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">(Captain Gibbons had left some
land by the sea which he wanted the people of Dungarvan to use as a
park. A park had been created and a monument erected. The Town
Commissioners then had their names inscribed on the monument. The
widow of Captain Gibbons complained about this and the names were
removed. The Town Commissioners then became known as the Scrubbers.

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Edmond O'Shea wrote in the
Waterford Star that "None of the great grandchildren of the
aforementioned 'scrubbers' will ever know that their great
grandfathers had a hand in converting the cabbage gardens and potato
plots into the present recreation grounds."</FONT></P>

YOU ARE GROWLING AT ME</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Captain Curran moved and Mr
O'Brien seconded that John Curran be moved to the Chair. Mr P.J.Power
MP and Mr J.J.Shea MP acknowledged receipt of resolution from the
Town Commissioners to drop the charges against John Curran and
M.J.Casey. An order preventing Mr Casey storing flour in the butter
market was rescinded. The following resolution was passed : "Please
allow Mr Casey to store a few tons of flour in the butter
market."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Edward McCarthy made a speech
hoping there would be no squabbling or recriminations at the present
board. He ended with a poem :</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">There should be peace at
home<BR>

Where we, Dungarvan Commissioners meet<BR>

Quarrels should never come;<BR>

And if on any subject we disagree<BR>

We should not proceed to fight<BR>

But conduct our business with harmony<BR>

As we hope to do tonight<BR>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">McCarthy - You must not object
to me standing up here, Mr Ryan. I will not stand here as often as it
suits me.</FONT></P>

objecting.</FONT></P>

meeting)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Before we leave I want
to give one cheer for the immortal Parnell. Vi va, vi va! Hip, hip,
hurrah.</FONT></P>

Ryan left.</FONT></P>

YOU ARE NOT FIT TO BE CHAIRMAN OF A PACK OF DONKEYS</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan said some "darstedly fiend
with human appearance" had sent the report of his appearance in court
to his sister a nun at Maryborough. He claimed that there were
policemen out to destroy him. He took a Bible out of his pocket and
kissing the Bible swore he was innocent of the charges. He then threw
the Bible on the table. "A feeling of sensation prevailed amongst
the members."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Thomas O'Conner - By what
authority does Orr sit in the Borough Court ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran ( to Ryan ) - You
are taking advantage of your position to cover your conviction at the
petty sessions. A most disgraceful thing. It was a cowardly thing for
any man to do it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - I don't own a rotten
public house.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran - It is a
disgrace.</FONT></P>

Richard Curran about his use of the quary.</FONT></I></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran (Chairman) said he
could not keep order with Mr Scanlan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Faith, you can not
because your mind is clouded with your own little games and the devil
else you think of.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Scanlan ( to Captain Curran) -
It is you were the cause of it all - with your dirty cringing ways.

YOU ARE AN OLD WEATHERCOCK</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Thomas Power told the Town
Commissioners that the Kilrush people where paying less water rates
than other areas. He said he was against corruption and this was
selling the people of the town for votes.</FONT></P>

THE CELEBRATED DUNGARVAN TOWN COMMISSIONERS</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">A letter to the Wexford
Independent</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">We have much reason to blush
for our local bodies. They are getting far too staid and respectable
altogether. How can they pretend they are doing anything worthy of
their positions when we compare them with the celebrated Dungarvan
Town Commissioners and the now more famous Kilkenny
Corporation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">A theatrical company or a
circus never had a ghost of a chance of earning an honest penny in
Dungarvan. When the theatre is open the people sit tightly at home
and wait serenely for the next meeting of the local board. Henry
Irvine, J.L.Toole, Mary Anderson and Dorothy Baird all together would
be a failure as a rival attraction once the ructions commence at the
town board. These are the Commissioners for my money.</FONT></P>

skirmish between John Scanlan and Michael J.Casey, who protested
that Scanlan had shoved him out of his seat. He said he was in the
seat before Scanlan.</FONT></P>

You were not heard of when I was sitting here.</FONT></P>

vulgar booby.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Discussion of &#163;50 payment
for work done by Mr Breary.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - I move that it be
paid.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Scanlan - It is referred to the
finance committee.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - No it is not, pay
it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Casey is boss of the
castle tonight. He is bullying all here tonight.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - Stop it now, I tell
you. I want no talk from a drunken rowdy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - G'long you bloody fat
headed hound. I will give you something in 10 minutes and I am not
afraid of your poker either - a revolver wouldn't frighten me.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - Try it, my
rowdy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - He had made up his mind
to insult everyone tonight - the bloody yahoo.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Captain Curran was supplying
the Town Commissioners with stones from his quarry. Scanlan said that
this was wrong and the Town Commissioners should advertise for a
quarry. Captain Curran, John Curran and Michael J.Casey opposed
this.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - I am straight. I am
ashamed to sit here.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran - You are lost.
Your character is gone. You are disgraced to be here at all.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - I am shocked at your
duplicity and chicanery. Why on earth can't you be straight ?</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Scanlan - He could if he liked
but it doesn't suit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Captain Curran then proposed
that on old employee of his Andy Dooley who had worked for him for 26
years be employed by the Town Commissioners to quarry stones. John
Curran supported Captain Currran's motion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Scanlan - Don't prostitute
yourself any more Mr Chairman.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - What are we doing here
at all, exposing ourselves to infamy and the newspapers. Look at him
(Captain Curran) scratching his nose over there !</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Captain Curran - Hold your
tongue, you rowdy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Hold your tongue, you
bloody old yahoo. That won't stop me.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran - Andy Dooley is
accepted.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael Foley (striking the
table) - We didn't come here to do jobs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran - Oh, didn't you do
a job for the theatrical company ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">O'Brien - Invite tendors. It is
a piece of robbery. We will resign if things go on like this.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran - I bet you a
sovereign you won't.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Thomas O'Conner - If 11 men and
myself agree to resign we will leave this board to the Currans and
Casey.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey protested and said he was
never in the bankruptcy court like some of his neighbours. Nothing
could be said of him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Scanlan - Mr O'Conner was known
here long before you came from Comeragh.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - I am not a
turncoat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Scanlan - G'long with
you.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Argument about the quarry
tender given to Andy Dooley.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan proposed that the tender

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran (Chairman) said he
would not accept the resolution.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael J.Casey - Next
business.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - We want none of your
bullocking or bulldozing. Who the devil could you frighten? We will
have no damn trick of the loop here.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Thomas O'Conner - Casey was
keeping 5 tons of flour in the Town Hall free of charge.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - What the blazes brings
this fellow from the foot of the Comeraghs to put the keys of the
Town Hall in his pocket and go round the country with it. What the
devil right has he to do that?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Patrick O'Brien said it was
wrong to give a man a shilling for quarrying stone when you could get
it for 6d.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran - It is all a
mistake. You are misled.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Do you here what the
villian says, that you are misled. That is another way of saying you
have no intelligence (laughter).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - I want to ask you a

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Argument about the Dungarvan
Band Stand.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">James F.Ryan - This is a matter
of great urgency - I will be heard. No man could have patience with
you. A saint in Heaven couldn't. You object to hear an educated man
speak - a B.A. of Trinity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - You never got the
degree.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - You are a liar and I
have the stamp of it. I want to speak on an important subject - the
bandstand in the park. This is urgent, so urgent that I can not defer
it longer, and I want to know -</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - Cut it short.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - I beg to propose that an
order be made to get the stand.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran had received a letter
about the bandstand which he refused to read. The Town Clerk went to
get the letter but he could not find it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - The Chairman had it
under the book (laughter).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran said the letter was
private and addressed to himself - the Chairman of the Town
Commissioners.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Thomas Power - And do you call
that a private letter - a letter for the Chairman of this board? Why
it is a letter for the board.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan attempted to give a speech
but he was interrupted by John Scanlan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Scanlan - Hold your tongue you

I WOULD TAKE YOU WITH ONE HAND AND SHAKE YOU AROUND THE
ROOM</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">J.F.Ryan - Casey was all night
roaring in a hoarse rather Billingsgate voice. No corner boy could be
worse (laughter).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Edmond McCarthy ( to Ryan) - I
would take you with one hand and shake you around the room. You are
an educated man. You are a tool to people here, but you ought to be
elsewhere.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran - Reply to that.
You are afraid of him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">McCarthy - I would take you
with one hand and shake you around the room.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Do you like that
?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - You are afraid of your
life of Mr McCarthy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Scanlan - He will not
insult him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan wants ladies to be able to
use the swimming area.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">M.J.Casey (to Ryan) - I want to
know was fined here for indecent behaviour and is that the man who
champions the ladies cause ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Ryan (to Casey) - Who is the
man that was sent to jail for nearly killing a man with a poker ? You
are an ignorant baboon. I never heard a sensible expression from your
lips - with your bloody big head.</FONT></P>

I WILL CRUSH YOU LIKE A RAT</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">James F.Ryan ( to John Curran)
- You were always rotten since you came from Ballingoul.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael J.Casey ( about James
F.Ryan) - His conduct is scandalous and disgraceful.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Shut up you rotten hound
you or I'll break your head. You garrulous, rhapsodical humbug. There
was never a sensible word come from your lips, you nonsensical
baboon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran - Ryan you are a
disgrace.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - You are a disgrace to
Dungarvan and I will put you out of the Chair.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - I will be here in

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - I will crush you like a

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - What am I?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - You are a Ring man and
you have the intelligence of a Ring man.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan began smoking near the
fireplace.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - Mr Chairman, stop this
smoking. I can't stand rotten tobacco.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Scanlan - Go along, you
ninnyhammer. I was in the town before you were in it. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Patrick O'Brien made a long
speech on the butter market.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Don't be making a fool
of yourself. You sent the butter market down to enrich Merry and a
Methodist ironmonger. It is over the Quay you ought to be with a
millstone around your neck.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Michael J.Casey objected to
Ryan's behaviour.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - Send for two police and
get that man removed, Mr Chairman.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Go along, you bosthoon,
with your two policemen. If I ever find you talking to my father or
going in to my father's house I will settle you. Why should you talk
of police for me, you bloody fellow. I handled a policeman when I was
15 years old on the square and thats more than you could do, you
bloody fellow.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran ( Chairman) later
interrupted Ryan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - How dare you dictate

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - How dare you, you bloody

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - I won't.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - You ignorant
clod.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">After a speech by Patrick
O'Brien, Thomas Power rose to reply and said that Mr O'Brien was an
honest man, but he was labouring under a delusion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">This expression created the
greatest wildness and noise.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Power tried to speak.</FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Power - What word?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - Delusion
(uproar)!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan (to Curran) - You are a
bloody deluder, you are.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">O'Brien - Who is Power that he
should use such language towards me?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - That's an insulting
word "delusion". You have transgressed the limits of decency.</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan (to Curran) - What is the
meaning of the word, Mr Chairman?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - Go to Webster. It is
an insult to Mr O'Brien.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - What is the meaning of
the word, Mr Chairman? You don't know, you bloody ignorant lout of a
Ballinagoul scrubber. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - Send for the
police.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - You fetid-headed
villian, hold your tongue.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">O'Brien - It is the grossest
impertinence of Power to use that word to me.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Edmund McCarthy - Mr Power
ought to withdraw that word.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan rose to speak and the
Chairman interrupted him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - How dare you, you bloody
bastard, talk to me like that?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">The Chairman put the question
to a vote as to whether Power should be called on to withdraw the
word delusion</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Captain Richard Curran, John
Curran (Chairman), Patrick O'Brien, Edmund McCarthy, Michael J.Casey
and John Scanlan voted that he should withdraw. The others refused to
vote. Thomas Power then addressed the press as he was prevented from
continuing his speech by the Chairman.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran ( to Edmund O'Shea,
reporter) - Mr O'Shea if you report what a private member says to you
then you will be in the wrong box.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">O'Shea - I will report what
occurs here and you shall not dictate to me as to what I shall report
(loud applause).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Subject became the butter
market.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Curran ( to Thomas
O'Conner) - You are jobbing at that market house for the past 30
years.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">O'Conner - Do you call me a
jobber?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - He did.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">O'Conner - You called me a
jobber and I will make you pay for it. My character is too well
known. I was never hunted out of a public board like you.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Give it to him, Tom. You
have him again! Don't let him off now - let him have it hot. That's
worse than "delusion".</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan (to Curran) - You went on
your knees before, but you won't be let off this time. Look at him
now, the benign smile on him like a Mellary monk, and the villainy in
his heart all the time.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">At this point the strains of
the band were heard coming to the Town Hall, playing "The Harp" and
Mr Hayes called for order for the band. The subject returned to the
bandstand. John Curran refused to take a resolution for the bandstand
to be erected.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Scanlan - Is it at the bridge
it will be erected?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - No, in your backyard?
Don't you know where it will be erected?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Scanlan said they were
squandering away the money.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Woe to you if you oppose
this bandstand. You would be hurled over the Quay.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan (to Curran) - The autocrat
of all the Russians never did such a thing as to refuse to put a
resolution for the board. The town of Dungarvan to be presided over
by a Turk from Ring that has as much brains as Madagascar
monkey.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - I brought you on to
the board.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - I want to refer to that
statement about the Chairman bringing me on to the board. You did it
as an instrument of revenge on a member of the press (Mr O'Shea)
because you were kicked out of the union. "I will get you in", he
said, "if you promise to crush O'Shea." Wasn't that damn nasty? Look
at him now like death's head with his driveling cadaverous
countenance. Look at old death's head in the chair.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - I have never seen such
traitors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan said if he smashed
Curran's face now he would have another summons.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - The case is penditt
lyty.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - Hold your tongue you
blasted clown - its pendente lite. Raise the price of admission, Tom,
to a shilling. Oh, the bloody clown - the classical scholar from
Ballingoul. When you can't speak English what the blazes do you go
into classics for? Blast you and may the devil hoist you.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Casey - Send for the police, Mr
Chairman, and have that man removed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan - It would take a regiment

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - On the 3rd of June I
presided at the meeting; Ryan was present; after the meeting a
discussion arose about the bathing strand...Ryan rushed towards me
with outstretched arms and closed fists and said he would smash my
bloody face. Mr McCarthy, Town Clerk, was there and put Mr Ryan back;
after that Ryan said he would do for me; he called me a "frosty faced
ignorant Ring man."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Ryan's lawyer - Did you say
Ryan came back in a sack from London ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran - No. I said he was sent
back in an donkey cart from Youghal with an old sack thrown over
him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">John Scanlan - Curran's
evidence was correct he made the same attack on me. If hell vomited

WHY CAN'T YOU BE STRAIGHT ?</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">The matter of Mr Wall's
election presented feature of novelty, while the disturbing element
was so much in evidence that a jolly row was looked forward to with
absolute certainty; and it transpired that preparations were made to
cope with it. First of all a crowd collected outside the Town Hall as
if a show or menagerie were in progress, and next we had a goodly
array of police constables in waiting outside the Town Commissioners'
doors with all the instruments necessary for the quelling of a
row.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">After resolution of condolence
was read for the family of the late John Butler, Town Commissioner,
John Curran declared that the meeting was adjourned a week in Butler's
memory. Most of the other Commissioners wanted to elect John Wall, in
Butler's place, before the adjurnment. John Curran said they must
adjourn. Resolutions were written by James Hayes and John Walsh
demanding that a vote be taken. Curran ripped up the resolutions.
John Wall then entered the room and threatened O'Brien, one of
Curran's supporters. The Town Clerk was called on to put the
resolution.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran (to Town Clerk) - Take
care of your books, I tell you, or you'll be sorry.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Curran then took the resolution
from the Town Clerk and tore it up.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Town Clerk - Why can't you be
straight ?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Keohan - He could get 5 or 6
years penal servitude for tearing that.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Another resolution was handed
to the Town Clerk and Thomas Power and James Hayes formed a bodyguard

An Appreciative Dog At The Corporate Meeting</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">On Monday night Mr Hayes
brought another dog to the meeting, but this animal seemed to be more
enlightened than his predecessor for he not only jumped to a vacant
seat at the boardroom table but looked intelligently around and
wagged his tail as if he were among old friends. This caused a great
deal of merriment, but the climax was capped when the animal jumped
upon the table and walked around it examining the countenance of each
member in turn. Mr Casey laughed hysterically.</FONT></P>

Dungarvan Urban Council. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">The meeting was held in the
Town Hall and attended by over 300 people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Archdeacon Sheedy said they
were there to nominate men who should possess certain qualifications
and one of the qualifications was that they should be upright and
honest. He had no object but he welfare of the town and
country.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Candidates proposed by priests
: William Lawlor, James Hayes, thomas Power, Michael Barry, Thomas
O'Conner, Edmond Keohan, Michael Power, John Wall, Patrick Veale,
Thomas Barry, Captain Sheehan and James Wheelan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Mr Edmund McCarthy TC, said
that he did not question the right of the Parish Priest to preside at
the meeting, but there was a minority of the electors present and
candidates should not be nominated from a minority.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Archdeacon Sheedy - You are
out.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">McCarthy - Maybe so.</FONT>

(loud applause).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">James Ryan - If the College of
Cardinals came there to support them they would not be
elected.</FONT></P>

were several good names on the list there were others that were a
useless lot.</FONT></P>

well have as many turnips there. I fear no man. This is a one sided
nomination (loud cries of order).</FONT></P>

often before.</FONT></P>

the priest.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Rev V.Landy - One thing was
apparent to everyone, and that was the disgraceful scenes that were
enacted at the Town Board, and they should endeavour to remove the
men that were the cause of them (applause).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Scanlan attempted to speak but
was shouted down. John Curran next attempted to speak, but there
arose a deafening din so that not a word of his could be heard. He
was seen to gesticulate wildly and work his hands with much vigor,
but his voice was not heard amid the uproar.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Father Prendergast said the
twelve selected were good men...They would succeed in wiping out the
disgrace that had fallen upon the people of Dungarvan for so many
years and the rowdyism which had been introduced at the meetings of
their Town Board (applause).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Archdeacon Sheedy said as
Parish Priest he was never more anxious for anything than he was for
the success of this meeting, because since he came to the parish the
scenes at the Town Board were painful to him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Archdeacon Sheedy - They
occupied my mind day and night. I could not tell you how painful they
were to me, because I love the Dungarvan people (loud applause)...'I
saw some papers from South America in which the Town Commissioners
were described as being a disgrace to the town. On holiday in England
a Presbyterian minister asked me where I lived and when I said
Dungarvan, he replied "Oh, you are a pack of cut-throats over there."
"No",said I, "we are as quiet and respectable as any in Europe."
(Loud applause) "But" said he "don't I see in the papers your Town
Commissioners are continually attacking each other." My dear people,
I could not tell you how painful it was to me... I thank you
sincerely for your votes of thanks, and I have the greatest
confidence that these 12 gentlemen, if elected, will never do
anything that you will regret or be ashamed of.</FONT></P>

all elected and referred to as the Twelve Apostles.)</FONT></P>

the world. Mr Hayes was one of those elected by the priests and
people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">James Hayes - Yes, I headed the
poll.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">Father Prendergast - Yes you
did when we canvassed for you, but if you took the other side you
would be beaten as the rest (cheers).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial" COLOR="#000000">James Hayes - I don't know
that.</FONT></P>
