<STRONG>What is this rubbish ?</STRONG><P>

Just a few snippets copied from the Waterford newspapers. Although I found these items intriguing I would be surprised if anyone else showed much interest in them. Most of the people of Dungarvan have no interest in the history of the place and they don't seem to care that it is being destroyed at an alarming rate. Fine old buildings are being allowed to deteriorate so that they can be knocked down and be replaced by hideous new houses or offices. The fools will not be happy until the place is covered by multistory carparks and supermarkets. <P>

<STRONG>Your "snippets" do not give the newspaper source. You've made it difficult to follow up any of those articles. </STRONG><P>

My notebooks show the date and newspaper source of each item, but when I typed up my notebooks I did not think the extra effort of typing in the newspaper source and date was worth it. It would be an attempt to give an air of academic importance to what is really an eccentric's fancy. I have sometimes combined items from more than one newspaper. Despite this, these combinations retain the original wording of the items. I have not summarized or substituted my own words for the original words. <P>

<STRONG>What Waterford newspapers have you read ? </STRONG><P>

The earliest papers I looked at were the Waterford Mirror and the Chronicle, but my main sources in the 19th century  were the Waterford News, the Munster Express, the Waterford Star and the Waterford Daily Mail.<P>



 <STRONG>This rubbish is going to offend some people. Have you though of that? </STRONG><P>
 
 I hope no one takes offence. If anyone has any comments or complaints they can email me at   <!-- , either by leaving a message on this ? or --><a href=mailto:mcdonaghl@hotmail.com>mcdonaghl@hotmail.com</a> <br>&nbsp;<br></td><P>
