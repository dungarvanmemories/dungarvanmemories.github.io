IF THAT CHILD LIVES HE MAY BE A GREAT MAN</STRONG><BR>

Head Constable John Ahearn, one of the most efficient and vigilant officers in this district, has rescued another juvenile wanderer from vice and wickedness in the form of Martin Horrigan, aged about 7 years, who had no guardian or protector. This is the illegitimate child of old "Shawneen Sugarstick" or John Horrigan, Abbeyside, a dealer in old iron for many years in the Square of Dungarvan. The old fellow emigrated to America some twelve or fourteen months ago, having at the time not less than £80. The cause of his exit being to avoid the maintenance of his would be wives, on whom he spent some pounds previous to his departure for the land of the Stars and Strips, where he succumbed to the iron grasp of death. Previous to his departure he had given 1s 6d to a Daniel Keleher of Abbeyside to look after the boy. Keleher had come before the court saying he could no longer afford to keep the boy.<P>
Chairman  (Sir John Nugent Humble) to Keleher - You ought to keep him some time longer.<P>
Keleher - Your worship I won't give him a bit after this day. I could not afford it.<P>
Chairman - Which would you be better pleased to be with - your mother or with Keleher.<P>
Child - I'd rather be with this man and his wife, because I get enough to eat from them.<P>
Chairman - If that child lives he may be a great man. He has a splendid forehead, one of the finest I ever saw on a child.<P>
After some further remarks the certificate was signed for his transfer to Cappoquin Industrial School.<P>

ONE BORN EVERY MINUTE</STRONG><P>
Petty Sessions<P>
Joseph Curran, Ballygambon charged Michael Keating with threatening him and throwing a bar of iron at him. Keating claimed he saw Curran milking one of his cows.<P>
Mr O'Connell to Curran - Were you not milking his cows ?<P>
Curran - I was not. I had a gallon in my head, and I was going for water as my family had scarlatina and I had no one to go for it. I am as innocent of that charge as the child that was born last night.<P>
Court - How do you know that a child was born last night ? (laughter)<P>
Mr O'Connell - It is said, your worship, that there is one born every minute. (renewed laughter)<P>
Keating was bound over to keep the peace.<P>

Rev Finn , Chairman - You rear and fatten your pigs and yet you are not able to eat the ear of one of them (cheers). Where does all the money go ? Why if finds its way into the landlord's pocket. You make your firkins of butter, but you are afraid to put a print of it on your table. No, you are not able to do so because it must all go to pay the rent (cheers). The eggs have gone into the landlord's pocket and what have they left you ?<P>

A voice - Begor, your reverence, they have left us nothing but the shells to look at (laughter).<P>

<STRONG>Jan 1882<BR>
RELEASED FROM NASS PRISON</STRONG><P>
Court Case<BR>
John Scanlan was suing John Wall, Vice-Chair of Dungarvan Board of Guardians to recover the cost of a threshing machine. John Wall had just been released from Nass prison. He had been sent there for organising a boycott of British goods. Wall's solicitor (Mr Hodnett) said Scanlan had petitioned for the release of Wall from prison, but he had only done that to be able to recover the money he was owed for the threshing machine.<P>

<STRONG>May 1882<BR>
BURGLAR HANGS HIMSELF</STRONG><P>

THE MAN'S SCREAMS WERE HEARD</STRONG><P>

Michael Leahy, 22, of Geosh's Bridge, Nr Classmore had chastened a boar who would not return to his sty with a whip. The next morning when he opened the sty the boar rushed at him and pinned him against a wall. The boar's tusk pierced a thigh and severed an artery. The boar continued to attack him on the ground. The man's screams were heard and several men armed with pitchforks and shovels forced the boar back into his sty. Leahy bled to death.<P>

<STRONG>Oct 1886<BR>
I WOULD RATHER BE HANGED THAN DROWNED</STRONG><P>

The schooner "Eugenie" , 126 tons, 5 crew, ran into a hooker, the "Kingfisher." <BR>The "Kingfisher" was a fishing boat anchored off Helvic Head. The "Eugenie" was heading for the Bristol Channel. The master of the "Eugenie", Patrick Higgins of Abbeyside, was censured by the inquiry for sailing over well known fishing grounds without giving attention to the lookout being properly kept. The "Kingfisher" , owned by John Nugent of Dungarvan, had four crew - John Nugent, George Sloan, Edward Whelan and Laurence Christopher. The first two were drowned. Laurence Christopher told the inquest he held on to a rope by the side of the "Eugenie" after the collision. The crew of the "Eugenie" then threw another rope down which got wrapped around his neck. "I said to let me go as I would as soon be drowned as hanged (laughter)." Higgins, who had held a master's certificate since 1867, said at the inquest that he did everything to save the men overboard. When asked what he had done he "I shouted out 'Save that man' and I ran to where the life buoys were kept, but found they were already thrown overboard." He did not launch the lifeboat because three men would be needed to handle it and there were other fishing boats in the area. It would not be safe to have just two men in control of the schooner. He searched the area but could not find the missing men.<P>

<STRONG>Dec 1897<BR>
LUCIFER THE GRUNTER</STRONG><P>

Anonymous letter attacking Garret Morrissey<P>

James Heafey of Ballinahassey 9 months ago petitioned the Dungarvan Board of Guardians to wall in a small spring which oozes out of rocks on the strand.  He had no water on his land. This application was opposed for 4 sittings by “Lucifer the grunter” and he finally won his case by having the water declared as unfit for consumption. When the sample results were read out to the Board of Guardians “Lucifer the grunter” received the news with a wild war whoop and he danced the “can-can” to the intense amusement of the Guardians in his mad enthusiasm of having ousted two hundred honest inhabitants of a drink of spring water. In a certain public house an hour after this glorious victory he whacked and cracked and smashed, cursed and swore to annihilate all the Heafeys, high and low, until the utterings of war whoops and the flying of splinters fought for supremacy in mid air, including the rattling of glasses, pewters and decanters, until the din and uproar resembled the exploding of a battery of bombshells, under the command of an escaped madman. He thought fit to change his line of attack and floated the standard of  victory on his homeward journey, still keeping the charge of crack, whack and smash with renewed energy, thanks to reinforcements - whiskey - until he arrived at his sacred domicile and fell exhausted into the arms of his colossal bull-beater, who came to greet him and share in the trophies of his glorious victory.<P>

Garret Morrissey bursts forward like a wretch in a St Vitus’s dance sort of carriage - his ferret like eyes, almost starting from their sockets, the sharp pointed hungry features, weak chin, concave forehead, malicious grin and his hang-gallows conduct.<P>

The poor people of Ring and Ballinacourty spend the long, cold winter nights up to their middles in salt water, endeavoring by every device and stratagem that their hands and brains could afford to keep a hold on the house of their ancestors, and dragging  out a life of drudgery, far worse than gallery slaves.<P>


<STRONG>Jul 1898<BR>
A LEPRECHAUN FROM BALLINAMEELA</STRONG><P>

A letter from J.Mooney, PLG, attacking William Stack.<P>

...Mr Stack awoke from dreamland, and thought well of giving vent to a burst of eloquence, the only effect of which was to display his own ignorance, which was hitherto confined to the members of the Board of Guardians who had the patience from time to time to listen to his nonsensical exhibitions.<P>

THAT ONE LOOKS LIKE A YOUNG SNAKE</STRONG><P>

Food production meeting at Dungarvan held by the Dungarvan and Garrenbane branches of the United Irish League. J.J.O'Shee MP addressed the meeting. He said the land is not being used to its full potential. More food could be grown. Charles Humble was using his 1354 acres of arable land for cattle. All he was growing  was a few turnips. O'Shee said he had gone to Humble's farm and pulled some of these turnips from the ground. Here O'Shea took 3 turnips from a paper bag and held them up to the meeting amid laughter. He hoped the meeting would pardon him for calling them turnips at all.<P>

THE IRISH PARTY WERE TRAITORS</STRONG><P>

Meeting to establish Sinn Fein Branch in Kilrossanty.<P>

Laurence Casey (Chairman) - Followers of the Irish Party say that it was the Party that stopped conscription from Ireland and is there any one here that believes that  (  No, No.) It was the rebellion in Dublin on Easter week that stopped conscription from Ireland (applause). The men who were shot stopped it (cheers) and but for their action many here today would be growing grass in France and what would they be fighting for.<P>

Mathias Walsh JP - They all followed the Irish Party too long. The County Council, District Councils and Boards of Guardians were passing resolutions of confidence in the Irish Party while at the same time the Party were selling Ireland. For the last eight or ten years the Irish Party were traitors.<P>

Michael Brennock - Sinn Fein were the only organisation that had practical politics for Ireland. At one time or another they were all followers of Parnell and Redmond. Some went so far as to say that all Irishmen should help England and fight the battles of small nationalities. They did so because they thought home rule would be enforced and that it would regenerate their country. For 700 years they were leading the lives of beggars and asking England's assistance, but to know avail. Now a new period in Irish history had began. Their people were determined to stand upon their own feet and to be no longer a mendicant at the door of the House of Commons.<P>

Asked if he was happy there he said "Well begor, sir, I wouldn't change it for Buckingham Palace."<P>
