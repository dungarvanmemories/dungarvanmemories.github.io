<h1>Notes from the Waterford Papers</h1>
<p><strong>May 1873<br/>
IF THAT CHILD LIVES HE MAY BE A GREAT
MAN</strong><br/>
Head Constable John Ahearn, one of the most
efficient and vigilant officers in this district, has rescued another
juvenile wanderer from vice and wickedness in the form of Martin
Horrigan, aged about 7 years, who had no guardian or protector. This
is the illegitimate child of old &quot;Shawneen Sugarstick&quot; or
John Horrigan, Abbeyside, a dealer in old iron for many years in the
Square of Dungarvan. The old fellow emigrated to America some twelve
or fourteen months ago, having at the time not less than &pound;80.
The cause of his exit being to avoid the maintenance of his would be
wives, on whom he spent some pounds previous to his departure for the
land of the Stars and Strips, where he succumbed to the iron grasp of
death. Previous to his departure he had given 1s 6d to a Daniel
Keleher of Abbeyside to look after the boy. Keleher had come before
the court saying he could no longer afford to keep the boy.</p>
<p>Chairman (Sir John Nugent Humble) to Keleher - You ought to keep
him some time longer.</p>
<p>Keleher - Your worship I won't give him a bit after this day. I
could not afford it.</p>
<p>Chairman - Which would you be better pleased to be with - your
mother or with Keleher.</p>
<p>Child - I'd rather be with this man and his wife, because I get
enough to eat from them.</p>
<p>Chairman - If that child lives he may be a great man. He has a
splendid forehead, one of the finest I ever saw on a child.</p>
<p>After some further remarks the certificate was signed for his
transfer to Cappoquin Industrial School.</p>
<p><strong>Jun 1878<br/>
ONE BORN EVERY MINUTE</strong></p>
<p>Petty Sessions</p>
<p>Joseph Curran, Ballygambon charged Michael Keating with
threatening him and throwing a bar of iron at him. Keating claimed he
saw Curran milking one of his cows.</p>
<p>Mr O'Connell to Curran - Were you not milking his cows ?</p>
<p>Curran - I was not. I had a gallon in my head, and I was going for
water as my family had scarlatina and I had no one to go for it. I am
as innocent of that charge as the child that was born last night.</p>
<p>Court - How do you know that a child was born last night ?
(laughter)</p>
<p>Mr O'Connell - It is said, your worship, that there is one born
every minute. (renewed laughter)</p>
<p>Keating was bound over to keep the peace.</p>
<p><strong>Jun 1879<br/>
CUT IT SHORT</strong></p>
<p>M.A.Anthony presided over a meeting of over 200 tenant farmers in
Dungarvan. J.Delahunty MP addressed the meeting.<br/>
He was
interrupted by M.Gleeson of Kilmacthomas - &quot;Cut it short. Time
and trains wait for no man (laughter).&quot; <br/>
Resolution passed
that owners should reduce rents.</p>
<p><strong>Mar 1881<br/>
GREAT LAND LEAGUE MEETING AT KILROSSANTY</strong></p>
<p>5000 at land league meeting at farm of John Power, Kilrossanty.</p>
<p>Rev Finn , Chairman - You rear and fatten your pigs and yet you
are not able to eat the ear of one of them (cheers). Where does all
the money go ? Why if finds its way into the landlord's pocket. You
make your firkins of butter, but you are afraid to put a print of it
on your table. No, you are not able to do so because it must all go
to pay the rent (cheers). The eggs have gone into the landlord's
pocket and what have they left you ?</p>
<p>A voice - Begor, your reverence, they have left us nothing but the
shells to look at (laughter).</p>
<p><strong>Jan 1882<br/>
RELEASED FROM NASS PRISON</strong></p>
<p>Court Case<br/>
John Scanlan was suing John Wall, Vice-Chair of
Dungarvan Board of Guardians to recover the cost of a threshing
machine. John Wall had just been released from Nass prison. He had
been sent there for organising a boycott of British goods. Wall's
solicitor (Mr Hodnett) said Scanlan had petitioned for the release of
Wall from prison, but he had only done that to be able to recover the
money he was owed for the threshing machine.</p>
<p>(Wall became a bankrupt and went from the position of workhouse
Guardian to workhouse inmate.)</p>
<p><strong>May 1882<br/>
BURGLAR HANGS HIMSELF</strong></p>
<p>Richard Condon, a burglar, hanged himself by accident after
breaking through a thatched roof.</p>
<p><strong>Oct 1886<br/>
THE MAN'S SCREAMS WERE HEARD</strong></p>
<p>Michael Leahy, 22, of Geosh's Bridge, Nr Classmore had chastened a
boar who would not return to his sty with a whip. The next morning
when he opened the sty the boar rushed at him and pinned him against
a wall. The boar's tusk pierced a thigh and severed an artery. The
boar continued to attack him on the ground. The man's screams were
heard and several men armed with pitchforks and shovels forced the
boar back into his sty. Leahy bled to death.</p>
<p><strong>Oct 1886<br/>
I WOULD RATHER BE HANGED THAN DROWNED</strong></p>
<p>The schooner &quot;Eugenie&quot; , 126 tons, 5 crew, ran into a
hooker, the &quot;Kingfisher.&quot; <br/>
The &quot;Kingfisher&quot;
was a fishing boat anchored off Helvic Head. The &quot;Eugenie&quot;
was heading for the Bristol Channel. The master of the &quot;Eugenie&quot;,
Patrick Higgins of Abbeyside, was censured by the inquiry for sailing
over well known fishing grounds without giving attention to the
lookout being properly kept. The &quot;Kingfisher&quot; , owned by
John Nugent of Dungarvan, had four crew - John Nugent, George Sloan,
Edward Whelan and Laurence Christopher. The first two were drowned.
Laurence Christopher told the inquest he held on to a rope by the
side of the &quot;Eugenie&quot; after the collision. The crew of the
&quot;Eugenie&quot; then threw another rope down which got wrapped
around his neck. &quot;I said to let me go as I would as soon be
drowned as hanged (laughter).&quot; Higgins, who had held a master's
certificate since 1867, said at the inquest that he did everything to
save the men overboard. When asked what he had done he &quot;I
shouted out 'Save that man' and I ran to where the life buoys were
kept, but found they were already thrown overboard.&quot; He did not
launch the lifeboat because three men would be needed to handle it
and there were other fishing boats in the area. It would not be safe
to have just two men in control of the schooner. He searched the area
but could not find the missing men.</p>
<p><strong>Dec 1886<br/>
LOSS OF THE EUGENIE</strong></p>
<p>The Eugenie was lost off Milford Haven. Captain Higgins and the
rest of the crew were rescued.

SUICIDE WITH HANDS TIED BEHIND HIS BACK</strong></p>
<p>Patrick Drohan, caretaker of Kealfaun farm, near Fews, was found
in Croumshinan Lake with his hand tied behind his back. At the
inquest Sergeant White said it was suicide. &quot;I do not see that
it could be anything but a case of suicide. There is no ill feeling
against him.&quot; A juror said he did not know how a man could tie
his hands behind his back as Patrick Drohan had done. Sergeant White
said it could be done. An open verdict of &quot;Found Drowned&quot;
was returned.</p>
<p><strong>Jul 1893<br/>

<p><strong>Dec 1894<br/>
COFFIN OF FARMER DUG UP AND LEFT BY THE
ROADSIDE</strong></p>
<p>A farmer at Ballycullane committed suicide. He was buried in
Kilgobnet churchyard. Because he was a suicide some people dug up the
coffin and left it by the roadside. The police were called. But a
party of people said the coffin would not be re-intered at Kilgobnet.
It was then taken to the pauper's graveyard at Pulla where, despite
protests, it was buried.</p>
<p><strong>Oct 1895<br/>

<p><strong>HERE I AM WHO FEARS NO DANGER ANYWHERE</strong></p>
<p>John Leahy, one of the Moresby rescuers, was charged with being
drunk. 
</p>
<p>When Leahy was called to the court he shouted &quot;Here I come.
One of the gallant volunteers.&quot;</p>
<p>Magistrate - Do you admit the offence?</p>
<p>Leahy - Certainly not. Here I am who fears no danger anywhere.</p>
<p>Dr Williams - After the event a good deal of them have been on the
spree.</p>
<p>Case adjourned for a month. 
</p>
<p>Leahy became violent on leaving the court. 
</p>
<p><strong>Mar 1897<br/>
A SWARM OF CROWS</strong></p>
<p>A labouring man passing by a graveyard at Ballymountin, Co
Kilkenny noticed a swarm of crows behaving oddly. Looking over the
graveyard he saw the swarm hovering over a baby asleep wrapped in a
shawl. He took the child to Slieverue police. The mother was traced
and turned out to be Mary Deedy, a servant,18, who had the child at
Waterford Workhouse and left with the child shortly after delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Mar 1897<br/>
EXTRAORDINARY SUBSIDENCE OF EARTH</strong></p>
<p>A son of Thomas Ryan was ploughing a field at Bullinamuck when the
two horses ploughing the field stunk into the earth for about 12
foot. The chains broke from the plough and the boy cut the ropes with
a penknife. An inclined passage was cut into the hole to allow the
horses to get out. It was supposed that the sandy bottom of the soil
was falling into a limestone cavern leaving only the skin of the soil
above. About 300 people were present when the horses were pulled out.</p>
<p><strong>Dec 1897<br/>
CONSTABLE COMMITTED SUICIDE</strong></p>
<p>Constable Michael Dillon, 24, originally from Listowel, committed
suicide at Kilmacthomas by shooting himself through the head. He left
the message &quot;I am tired of life. I am going to shoot myself. All
through drink.&quot; People were surprised by the message. He never
seemed to drink much.</p>
<p><strong>Dec 1897<br/>
LUCIFER THE GRUNTER</strong></p>
<p>Anonymous letter attacking Garret Morrissey</p>
<p>James Heafey of Ballinahassey 9 months ago petitioned the
Dungarvan Board of Guardians to wall in a small spring which oozes
out of rocks on the strand. He had no water on his land. This
application was opposed for 4 sittings by &ldquo;Lucifer the grunter&rdquo;
and he finally won his case by having the water declared as unfit for
consumption. When the sample results were read out to the Board of
Guardians &ldquo;Lucifer the grunter&rdquo; received the news with a
wild war whoop and he danced the &ldquo;can-can&rdquo; to the intense
amusement of the Guardians in his mad enthusiasm of having ousted two
hundred honest inhabitants of a drink of spring water. In a certain
public house an hour after this glorious victory he whacked and
cracked and smashed, cursed and swore to annihilate all the Heafeys,
high and low, until the utterings of war whoops and the flying of
splinters fought for supremacy in mid air, including the rattling of
glasses, pewters and decanters, until the din and uproar resembled
the exploding of a battery of bombshells, under the command of an
escaped madman. He thought fit to change his line of attack and
floated the standard of victory on his homeward journey, still
keeping the charge of crack, whack and smash with renewed energy,
thanks to reinforcements - whiskey - until he arrived at his sacred
domicile and fell exhausted into the arms of his colossal
bull-beater, who came to greet him and share in the trophies of his
glorious victory.</p>
<p>Garret Morrissey bursts forward like a wretch in a St Vitus's
dance sort of carriage - his ferret like eyes, almost starting from
their sockets, the sharp pointed hungry features, weak chin, concave
forehead, malicious grin and his hang-gallows conduct.</p>
<p>The poor people of Ring and Ballinacourty spend the long, cold
winter nights up to their middles in salt water, endeavouring by
every device and stratagem that their hands and brains could afford
to keep a hold on the house of their ancestors, and dragging out a
life of drudgery, far worse than gallery slaves.</p>
<p><strong>Jul 1898<br/>
A LEPRECHAUN FROM BALLINAMEELA</strong></p>
<p>A letter from J.Mooney, PLG, attacking William Stack.</p>
<p>...Mr Stack awoke from dreamland, and thought well of giving vent
to a burst of eloquence, the only effect of which was to display his
own ignorance, which was hitherto confined to the members of the
Board of Guardians who had the patience from time to time to listen
to his nonsensical exhibitions.</p>
<p><strong>Mar 1900<br/>

THE WILDNESS OF THESE TERRIBLE
IRRESPONSIBLES</strong></p>
<p>Constable Croke coming on the scene of tramps fighting on Main St
dealt a couple of dexterous strokes at the ferocious mauraders, which
had an instantaneous effect. However, the rowdies were of a reckless
disposition and struggled with grim determination and it was only on
the constables drawing and making use of their batons that the
defenders of the law triumphed. It required coolness and vigour to
overcome the wildness of these terrible irresponsibles.</p>
<p><strong>Feb 1917<br/>
THAT ONE LOOKS LIKE A YOUNG SNAKE</strong></p>
<p>Food production meeting at Dungarvan held by the Dungarvan and
Garrenbane branches of the United Irish League. J.J.O'Shee MP
addressed the meeting. He said the land is not being used to its full
potential. More food could be grown. Charles Humble was using his
1354 acres of arable land for cattle. All he was growing was a few
turnips. O'Shee said he had gone to Humble's farm and pulled some of
these turnips from the ground. Here O'Shea took 3 turnips from a
paper bag and held them up to the meeting amid laughter. He hoped the
meeting would pardon him for calling them turnips at all.</p>
<p>A Voice - That one looks like a young snake.</p>
<p>O'Shee then referred to the Chairman John Greene JP. There was no
farmer who knew more about the growing of turnips, not to speak of
cabbages, than he does -</p>
<p>A Voice - But, sure he takes all the good out of it when he
charges too much for them (laughter).</p>
<p><strong>Jul 1917<br/>
THE IRISH PARTY WERE TRAITORS</strong></p>
<p>Meeting to establish Sinn Fein Branch in Kilrossanty.</p>
<p>Laurence Casey (Chairman) - Followers of the Irish Party say that
it was the Party that stopped conscription from Ireland and is there
any one here that believes that ( No, No.) It was the rebellion in
Dublin on Easter week that stopped conscription from Ireland
(applause). The men who were shot stopped it (cheers) and but for
their action many here today would be growing grass in France and
what would they be fighting for.</p>
<p>Mathias Walsh JP - They all followed the Irish Party too long. The
County Council, District Councils and Boards of Guardians were
passing resolutions of confidence in the Irish Party while at the
same time the Party were selling Ireland. For the last eight or ten
years the Irish Party were traitors.</p>
<p>Michael Brennock - Sinn Fein were the only organisation that had
practical politics for Ireland. At one time or another they were all
followers of Parnell and Redmond. Some went so far as to say that all
Irishmen should help England and fight the battles of small
nationalities. They did so because they thought home rule would be
enforced and that it would regenerate their country. For 700 years
they were leading the lives of beggars and asking England's
assistance, but to know avail. Now a new period in Irish history had
began. Their people were determined to stand upon their own feet and
to be no longer a mendicant at the door of the House of Commons.</p>
<p><strong>Oct 1917<br/>
THE FOOD TAKEN FROM THE HUNGRY CHILDREN'S
MOUTHS</strong></p>

onlookers. Ed Dee, President Dungarvan Sinn Fein branch presided.
Speakers included Count Plunkett MP,Harry Boland, Father O'Shea,
Ballinameela, Michael Brennock, Michael Ryan and Daniel Fraher.</p>
<p>Count Plunkett - They talked about Nero saying that he wished Rome
had but one neck that he could strike it off. England wished that
Ireland had but one mouth so that she could starve it. Ireland will
never again allow the food to be taken from hungry children's mouths.</p>
<p><strong>Dec 1917<br/>
I AM ALL RIGHT, BUT I LOST MY LEG</strong></p>
<p>Death of Michael Casey, son of John Casey, pig buyer , Waterford.
